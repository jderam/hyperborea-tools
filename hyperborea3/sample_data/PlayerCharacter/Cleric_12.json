Furthermore, the sorcerer will, through otherworldly guidance, apprehend the most efficient way to achieve the location, retaining this information even after the spell\u2019s duration has elapsed. For example, if a crevasse presents an obstacle, the sorcerer will understand the best way around it, even comprehending the existence of a secret door that must be accessed in order to reach the chosen place. Even traps may be avoided. If, for example, Saturn is sought, the location of a rocket ship or teleportation device might be gleaned. Once the spell\u2019s duration has elapsed, the sorcerer retains a general idea of what must be done; however, any attempt to map, record, or otherwise disclose this data to others will cause the <i>path</i> to be forgotten.</p> <p>The reverse of this spell, <i>forget the path</i>, is a touch spell that causes its victim to become lost and wander aimlessly for the duration of the spell unless they make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.</p>"
