For example, a 5th-level magician\u2019s toad swarm inflicts 1d4+5 hp damage per round. One may attempt an <i>extraordinary feat of strength</i> to break free (the referee may need to dice for the strength score on the spot, using 3d6 or 4d6 drop low); otherwise, the victim remains <i>prone</i>, unable to take any other actions. Other methods of escape must be adjudicated by the referee on a case-by-case basis. A <i>toad swarm</i> can be directed to hop to another opponent within range, but 1 round will elapse for every 30 feet between targets.</p>"
