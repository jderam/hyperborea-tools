These spikes may be discerned via <i>detect snares and pits</i>, <i>detect traps</i>, or <i>true seeing</i>; otherwise, all seems perfectly natural until the enchanted area is traversed. For every 10 feet of affected area negotiated, the subject( s) must make an <i>avoidance</i> saving throw or suffer 1d4 hp damage. The caster can dismiss this spell at will.</p>"
