The sorcerer can stand within the epicentre of the effect, or 300 yards outside its verge, and can <i>control weather</i> for as long as he or she concentrates. Possibilities include:</p> <ul><li><i>Rain:</i> Visibility compromised; missile attacks at \u22122 \u201cto hit,\u201d movement reduced to half.</li> <li><i>Snow:</i> Visibility reduced to 20 feet, with snow collecting at 2 inches per hour: \u221210 MV at 6 inches; \u221220 MV at 12 inches.</li> <li><i>Fog:</i> Visibility reduced to 20 feet.</li> <li><i>Clear/Partly Cloudy Skies:</i> Cancels the effects of stormy weather.</li> <li><i>Blistering Heat:</i> Temperature rises to 100\u00b0F.</li> <li><i>Frigid Cold:</i> Temperature drops to 0\u00b0F.</li> <li><i>High Winds:</i> Gale winds (40\u201350 mph) prevent missile fire and can drive flying creatures to the ground; this bluster can benefit sailing ships (at the lower range of gale power), increasing vessel speed by 50% or more.</li> <li><i>Hail:</i> Hail batters all in the area, reducing movement by half and damaging roofs and other structures.</li> <li><i>Tornado:</i> A thunderhead manifests under which a powerful whirlwind forms. The tornado is 500 feet in diameter and moves as directed by the sorcerer. Creatures of 1\u20132 HD in its path must make <i>avoidance</i> saves or be swept away, suffering 3d8 hp damage, being hurled 1d10\u00d710 feet in the air, and falling for another 1d6 hp damage per 10 feet. Creatures of 3 HD or more must make <i>avoidance</i> saves or sustain 3d8 hp damage, but are not hurled in the air. This form of <i>control weather</i> persists only 1 round per CA level.</li></ul>"
