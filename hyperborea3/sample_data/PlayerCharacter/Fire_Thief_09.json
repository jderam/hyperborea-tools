Damaging objects does not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly to another creature does not break the spell.

One can set aflame the wooden tower of a <b>vampire</b> and not break the spell, even if the undead beast burns, but if one throws a <i>fireball</i> at the same vampire, that is direct harm. Set a deadfall trap with a boulder to crush the skull of a <b>giant weasel</b>? <i>Invisibility</i> does not break. Shoot the same beast with a heavy crossbow? <i>Invisibility</i> breaks. <i>Sleep</i> spell causes no harm and typically involves no saving throw, so it will not break <i>invisibility</i>. Of course, the referee should be the final arbiter of all such cases.</p>"
