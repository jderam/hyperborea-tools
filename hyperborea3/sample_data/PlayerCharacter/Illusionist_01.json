Credibility may come into question because of the soundlessness of the illusion (e.g., a charging mammoth); in other instances, such as a <i>phantasm</i> of fire, a lack of thermal properties can create suspicion. To the eyes of the disbeliever, the <i>phantasm</i> becomes a flawed and flickering transparent image. An intelligent disbeliever may then alert allies, whose saves are made at a bonus of +4.
