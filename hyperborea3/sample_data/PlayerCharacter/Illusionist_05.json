The illusion can be of sight, sound, smell, and/or temperature. The auditory component might include a shout, a roar, or a sentence of no more than nine words in length (not including articles <i>a</i>, <i>an</i>, and <i>the</i>).</p> <p>Once cast, this spell persists as long as the caster concentrates and for 5 rounds thereafter unless the illusion is struck for at least 1 hp of damage or is terminated via a <i>dispel phantasm</i> spell. A <i>spectral phantasmal</i> monster is AC 7 and will disappear if hit; otherwise, it can continue to attack as manipulated by the caster. The illusion can be directed to move anywhere within the spell\u2019s range; such manoeuvres require the full attention of the caster, who can walk at half speed and maintain control.</p> <p><i>Spectral phantasm</i> targets are not allowed saving throws unless the referee feels the illusion is unbelievable to the viewers, in which case <i>sorcery</i> saving throws should be rolled, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable. With sight, sound, smell, and/or temperature, credibility is rarely an issue with this spell; if such a case arises, and the save is made, the disbeliever will see the <i>spectral phantasm</i> as a flawed and flickering transparent image. An intelligent disbeliever may then alert allies, whose saves are made at a bonus of +4. Otherwise, this illusion can inflict real physical damage: 1d6 hp per CA level per round to each victim. Such damage remains even if the spell is subsequently broken.</p>"
