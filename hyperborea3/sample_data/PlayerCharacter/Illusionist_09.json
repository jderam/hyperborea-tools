If successful, the illusion will begin to shimmer, and the invisible object is revealed. If the saving throw fails, the subject believes that contact was made with an invisible object. Note that casual and careful touching of masked objects is not cause for a saving throw because the illusion cannot be disrupted unless handled with force. <i>Dispel phantasm</i> can break this spell, revealing that which is concealed by the illusion, but <i>dispel magic</i> and <i>detect invisibility</i> are ineffective.</p>"
