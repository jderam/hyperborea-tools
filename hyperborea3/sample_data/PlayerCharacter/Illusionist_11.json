If successful, they clearly discern the invisible creature as a translucent figure.</li></ul> <p><i>What constitutes harm:</i> \u201cHarm\u201d is defined as any action (melee, missile, spell, item use, etc.) that would directly damage another creature; i.e., cause <i>hit point</i> (hp) loss or cause the target to roll a saving throw. Damaging objects does not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly to another creature does not break the spell. Casting a spell that does not allow for a saving throw and does not physically harm the target will not break the spell (a convenient loophole, if you would).</p> <p>Thus, without breaking the spell, an invisible person can force open a door, lift a portcullis, steal a coin purse, pick a lock, cast a <i>cure light wounds</i> spell, cast a <i>protection from evil</i> spell, and even cast a <i>summon monster</i> spell (harm caused by summoned monster is indirect). One can set aflame the wooden tower of a <b>vampire</b> and not break the spell, even if the undead beast burns, but if one throws a <i>fireball</i> at the same vampire, that is direct harm. Set a deadfall trap with a boulder to crush the skull of a <b>giant weasel</b>? <i>Invisibility</i> does not break. Shoot the same beast with a heavy crossbow? <i>Invisibility</i> breaks. <i>Sleep</i> spell causes no harm and typically involves no saving throw, so it will not break <i>invisibility</i>. Of course, the referee should be the final arbiter of all such cases.</p>"
