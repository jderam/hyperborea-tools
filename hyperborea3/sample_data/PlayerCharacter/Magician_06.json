                    "spell_desc": "<p>A visual illusion is created, a projected image of nearly anything the caster can imagine, as large as 20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20 feet in area. Victims must be living creatures of animal intelligence or greater; undead, constructs, oozes, and the like are unaffected. <i>Phantasm</i> can be used to create an attacking monster or another damaging hazard, but the illusion is strictly of sight, not of sound, smell, or temperature.</p> <p>Once cast, this spell persists as long as the caster concentrates, unless the illusion is touched or terminated via a <i>dispel phantasm</i> spell. A <i>phantasmal</i> monster is AC 9 and will disappear if hit; otherwise, it can continue to attack as manipulated by the caster. The caster can direct the illusion to move anywhere within the spell\u2019s range; such manoeuvres require complete concentration, and no movement is allowed.</p> <p><i>Phantasm</i> targets are not allowed saving throws unless the referee feels the illusion is unbelievable to the viewers, in which case <i>sorcery</i> saving throws should be rolled, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable. Credibility may come into question because of the soundlessness of the illusion (e.g., a charging mammoth); in other instances, such as a <i>phantasm</i> of fire, a lack of thermal properties can create suspicion. To the eyes of the disbeliever, the <i>phantasm</i> becomes a flawed and flickering transparent image. An intelligent disbeliever may then alert allies, whose saves are made at a bonus of +4. Otherwise, this illusion can inflict real physical damage: 1d4 hp base damage, +1 hp damage per CA level, per round to each victim. Such damage remains even if the spell is subsequently broken.</p>"
