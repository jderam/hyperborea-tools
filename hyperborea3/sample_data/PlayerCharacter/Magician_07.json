Each thick and slimy tentacle is 10 feet long, AC 4, and equal in hit points to the sorcerer at full health. Any creature within range of a <i>black tentacle</i> is subject to attack; if a tentacle has more than one potential target, the referee should assign equal chances via random die roll.</p> <p>Each victim must make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the tentacle lashes the target for 1d6 hp damage before disappearing. If the saving throw fails, the tentacle lash delivers 1d6 hp damage, as well as constricting and rending the victim for a further 2d6 hp damage per round until the spell ends or the tentacle is destroyed. As the tentacles have no intelligence, they will continue to squeeze a dead body and might on occasion be fooled into constricting a barrel, statue, tree, or like object.</p>"
