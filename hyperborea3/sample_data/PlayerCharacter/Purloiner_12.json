If the audience is not of the caster\u2019s species (humanoids or giants, for example), or if they are otherwise unfriendly towards the caster\u2019s particular background, the saving throw is made at a +1 to +4 bonus (as judged by the referee). For a large audience, similar HD listeners may be grouped together. <i>Enthralled</i> creatures will continue to listen to the expounding sorcerer, viewing the orator as having 18 charisma. Those who make the save may have an unfavorable reaction, seeing the orator as boring, offensive, foolish, and/or disgusting. Once the sorcerer ceases evangelizing, the spell will terminate, but effects remain for 1 turn.</p>"
