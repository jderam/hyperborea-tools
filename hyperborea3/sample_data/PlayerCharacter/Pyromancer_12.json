For every CA level of the sorcerer, five square feet of metal can be affected, equivalent to one Small creature per CA level, or one Medium creature per 2 CA levels; e.g., a CA 6 sorcerer can affect three adjacent armoured people. For larger creatures, the referee must determine a reasonable number of potential targets using the above guidelines (e.g., a <b>mountain ape</b> may be considered the equivalent of two people). <i>Heat metal</i> is quick to warm, burn, and then sear; likewise, it is quick to cool. The dweomer persists for 9 rounds, with metal treated thusly if in contact with skin:</p> <ul><li><b>Round 1:</b> Metal becomes <i>hot</i>, uncomfortable to the touch</li> <li><b>Rounds 2\u20134:</b> Metal becomes <i>extremely hot</i>, burning for 1d4 hp damage per round</li> <li><b>Round 5:</b> Metal <i>sears</i> for 2d4 hp damage</li> <li><b>Rounds 6\u20138:</b> Metal cools to <i>extremely hot</i>, burning for 1d4 hp damage per round</li> <li><b>Round 9:</b> Metal cools to <i>hot</i></li></ul> <p>Materials such as cloth, leather, or wood in touch with <i>searing</i> metal are subject to smouldering or even combusting, as per the referee\u2019s judgment. <i>Fire protection</i> and <i>fire resistance</i> negate the harmful effects of this spell.</p>"
