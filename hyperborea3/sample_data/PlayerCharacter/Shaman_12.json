Furthermore, a tiny replica of that same chest must be crafted, about the size of a ring box. The total cost can be no less than 2,000 gp, as the materials used might include the rarest wood, mammoth ivory, gold hinges, and the like. The sorcerer then enchants the chest and its tiny replica by way of a 1-turn ritual.</p> <p>The larger chest can contain one cubic foot of material per CA level, regardless of its actual size, but living creatures ruin the spell if placed within. Upon completion of the spell, the larger chest disappears to some nether realm within the Black Gulf. So long as the miniature replica chest is kept safe, the larger one may be recalled by the sorcerer at any time. If the <i>secret chest</i> is not recalled before the duration elapses, it is permanently lost to the illimitable depths of the Black Gulf. Once the spell expires, a new set of chests must be crafted before casting this spell again. A sorcerer cannot maintain more than one <i>secret chest</i>.</p>"
