Range is not a factor when casting this spell, so long as the caster is on the same planet, plane of existence, and dimension as the targeted location. If <i>clairvoyance</i> is used to view one who is 10 HD or greater, the target may make a <i>sorcery</i> save to cognize the effect; otherwise, they are ignorant. Lastly, if used in conjunction with <i>clairaudience</i>, the sorcerer both hears and sees the envisioned location.</p>"
