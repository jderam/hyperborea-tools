And if a poison has a delayed onset, it too is further <i>delayed</i>. Once the spell has ended, the poison\u2019s effects resume as normal.</p> <p>Note that if the poison affliction is the result of a venomous bite or sting, this spell can be used in conjunction with <i>draw poison</i> ability of barbarians and shamans. With the poison magically suspended in the victim\u2019s system, a barbarian or shaman can <i>draw poison</i> on a 5-in-6 chance of success for the duration of the spell.</p> <p>Lastly, <i>delay poison</i> may also revive one who has expired from poison, so long as the spell is cast within 12 rounds (2 minutes) of death and a successful <i>trauma survival</i> check is made (see <b>Chapter 3: Statistics</b>, <i>constitution</i>). The deceased poison victim is restored to 0 hp, albeit at a permanent loss of 1 constitution point.</p>"
