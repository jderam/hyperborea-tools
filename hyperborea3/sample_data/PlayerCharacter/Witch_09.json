Alternatively, it can be called upon to use its <i>tongues</i> ability to converse with any intelligent creature present. Lastly, it instead can grant wisdom by use of its <i>contact otherworldly being</i> ability, with no risk of insanity. No matter the case, once the d\u00e6mon has completed its service, the standard chance of betrayal applies; however, in the latter case (<i>contact otherworldly being</i>), each question beyond the first increases the d\u00e6mon\u2019s chance of betrayal by 1-in-6.</li> <li><b>Seeker</b>: <i>Summons</i> a single <b>class xv lesser d\u00e6mon</b> to search and destroy. When the <i>seeker</i> type is designated, the sorcerer also must describe the prey (name, species, and so forth). The d\u00e6mon then will <i>teleport</i> itself and the sorcerer before said prey and attempt to slay it, after which the standard chance of betrayal applies. If no prey exists, the d\u00e6mon will attack the sorcerer and/or any comrades. Alternatively, this d\u00e6mon can be asked to <i>plane shift</i> the sorcerer and as many as five allies. This act of utter desperation cannot be undone by the same or another lesser d\u00e6mon; it is permanent, barring some other means of translocation. The d\u00e6mon then either will disappear (laughing all the while) or will turn on the sorcerer and any allies (q.v.).</li></ul> <p><i>Betrayal:</i> D\u00e6mons are infamous for betrayal. Upon completing their prescribed task, they may turn on the sorcerer and/or any allies on a 1-in-6 chance. D\u00e6mons are, however, subject to morale checks during the entire <i>summon d\u00e6mon</i> process. Those that fail will attempt to flee (if possible), now permanent inhabitants of Hyperborea that may one day seek revenge. Wise sorcerers are known to take sanctuary within the confines of a candlelit magic circle whilst casting and maintaining this spell; of course, the magic circle will only protect the sorcerer, not allies.</p>"
