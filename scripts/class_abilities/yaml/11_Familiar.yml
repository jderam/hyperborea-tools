title: Familiar
desc: "<p>To summon a small animal (bat, cat, owl,
rat, raven, snake, etc.) of 1d3+1 hp to
function as a <i>familiar</i> (singular creature
with uncanny connexion to the sorcerer).</p>
<p>Retaining a familiar provides
the following benefits:</p>
<ul><li>Within range 120 (feet
indoors, yards outdoors),
the magician can see
and hear through the
animal; sight is narrowly
focused, sounds reverberate
metallically.</li>
<li>The hit point total of the
familiar is added to the
magician’s total.</li>
<li>The magician can memorize
one extra spell of
each available spell level
per day (e.g., a 5th-level
magician gains bonus
level 1, 2, and 3 spells).</li></ul>
<p>These benefits are lost if the
familiar is rendered dead,
unconscious, or out of range.</p>
<p>The familiar is an extraordinary example of the species,
has a perfect <i>morale</i> score (ML 12), and always
attends and abides the will of its master. To summon
a familiar, the magician must perform a series of rites
and rituals for 24 hours. To determine result, roll 2d8
on <b>Table 10</b> below.</p>

<p>If the familiar dies, the magician also sustains 3d6 hp
damage. The magician cannot summon another familiar
for 1d4+2 months.</p>"
