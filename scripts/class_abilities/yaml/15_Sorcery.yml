desc: "<p>Magicians cast spells that they memorize from arcane
tomes. The number and levels of spells cast per day
are charted above (see <b>Table 9</b>), though magicians of
high intelligence gain bonus spells cast per day (see
<b>Chapter 3: Statistics</b>, <i>intelligence</i>); also, magicians
who retain a <i>familiar</i> (see above) gain bonus spells
cast per day. For example, a 4th-level magician with 13
intelligence can cast four level 1 spells and two level
2 spells per day. If the same magician also keeps a
<i>familiar</i>, spells cast per day improve to five level 1
spells and three level 2 spells.</p>
<p>A magician begins with a spell book that contains
three level 1 spells drawn from the <b>Magician
Spell List</b> (see <b>Chapter 7: Sorcery</b>, <b>Table 93</b>).
Through personal research, magicians develop
one new spell at each level gain; this spell is
learnt automatically, with no need of a qualification
roll, but it must be of a castable level (see
<b>Table 9</b> above).</p>
<ul><li><b>Initial no. of spells known</b>: ×3</li>
<li><b>No. of spells gained per level</b>: ×1</li></ul>
<p>Additional spells may be learnt outside of level
training, but the process is more arduous (see
<b>Chapter 7: Sorcery</b>, <i>acquiring new spells</i>).</p>"
