title: Scroll Writing
desc: "<p>To scribe a known spell onto a scroll, creating a single-use
magical device at a cost of 500 gp + 100 gp per spell level.
Materials vary: Some clerics engrave thin tablets of stone,
whereas others use vellum or parchment, a fine quill, and
sorcererâ€™s ink, such as sepia. This involved process requires
one week per spell level and must be completed on
consecrated ground, such as a shrine, fane, or temple.</p>"
