desc: "<p>Clerics memorize and cast spells, but they do not maintain
spell books; rather, they might bear the scriptures
of their faiths in prayer books, on sacred scrolls, or on
graven tablets. The number and levels of spells cast
per day are charted above (see <b>Table 12</b>), though clerics
of high wisdom gain bonus spells cast per day (see
<b>Chapter 3: Statistics</b>, <i>wisdom</i>). For example, a 4th-level
cleric with 13 wisdom can cast three level 1 spells
and two level 2 spells per day.
Clerics begin their careers with knowledge of three
level 1 spells, sacred mysteries revealed through initiation
into a sect or cult devoted to an otherworldly
power, deific being, or ethos. These spells are drawn
from the <b>Cleric Spell List</b> (see <b>Chapter 7: Sorcery</b>,
<b>Table 99</b>). Clerics develop three new spells at each
level gain, but they must be of castable levels (see
<b>Table 12</b> above). Typically, they are acquired via spiritual
revelation, otherworldly favour, or the piecing
together of abstract theologies. Such spells are learnt
automatically, with no need of qualification rolls.
<ul><li><b>Initial no. of spells known</b>: ×3</li>
<li><b>No. of spells gained per level</b>: ×3</li></ul>
Additional spells may be learnt outside of level training,
but the process is more arduous (see <b>Chapter 7:
Sorcery</b>, <i>acquiring new spells</i>)."
