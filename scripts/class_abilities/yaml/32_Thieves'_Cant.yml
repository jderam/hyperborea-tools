title: Thieves' Cant
desc: "<p>The secret language of thieves, a strange pidgin in
which some words may be unintelligible to an ignorant
listener, whereas others might be common yet of alternative
meaning. This covert tongue is used in conjunction
with specific body language, hand gestures, and
facial expressions. Two major dialects of Thievesâ€™ Cant
are used in Hyperborea: one by city thieves, the other
by pirates; commonalities exist betwixt the two.</p>"
