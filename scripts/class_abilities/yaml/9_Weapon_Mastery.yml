title: Weapon Mastery
desc: "<p><i>Mastery</i> of two weapons (+1 “to hit” and +1 damage).
Additional weapons may be mastered at 4th, 8th, and 12th
levels; however, see <i>grand mastery</i> below, for another
option. As noted in <b>Chapter 6: Equipment</b>, the attack
rate for melee weapons and the rates of fire for most
missile weapons improve through weapon mastery. For
more information on weapon mastery, see <b>Chapter 9:
Combat</b>, <i>weapon skill</i>.</p>
<b>GRAND MASTERY</b>
<p>At 4th, 8th, or 12th level (player’s choice), when a new
weapon mastery is gained, fighters may elect to intensify
their training with an already mastered weapon.
With this weapon the fighter becomes a grand master
(+2 “to hit” and +2 damage, increased attack rate,
etc.). A fighter may achieve <i>grand mastery</i> with but
one weapon. For more information, see <b>Chapter 9:
Combat</b>, <i>weapon skill</i>.</p>"
