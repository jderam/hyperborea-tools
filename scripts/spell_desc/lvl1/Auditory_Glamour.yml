Desc: "<p>A hallucination of sound is created, that of voices, calls, or cries (human, humanoid, animal, or monster); footfalls; or other like noises. The sounds of 1d4 creatures can be invented thus for each CA level of the sorcerer. However, if a sound is of significant volume, the referee must decide on the number of voices and their collective volume (e.g., the roar of one lion may be equal to the shouts of five people).</p>"
