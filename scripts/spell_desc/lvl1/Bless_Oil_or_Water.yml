Desc: "<p>This 6-turn (1-hour) ritual is performed exclusively
by sorcerers of Good alignment. A holy benediction
is placed on an eight-ounce vessel of vegetable oil or
fresh water, thus creating a dose of holy oil or holy
water. Sorcerers of CA 1–4 can cast this spell but once
per month; those of CA 5–8 can cast this spell twice
per month; and those of CA 9–12 can cast this spell
thrice per month. <i>Bless oil or water</i> must be cast on
hallowed ground, or on that which has been sanctified
by a <i>ceremony of consecration</i> spell. A glass vessel of
holy oil/water thrown as a missile at an undead target
delivers 1d8 hp damage per round for 2 rounds if a hit
is scored. Hurling a vessel of holy oil/water is executed
by use of the <i>flask hurling</i> rules (see <b>Chapter 9:
Combat</b>, <i>combat options</i>).</p>"
