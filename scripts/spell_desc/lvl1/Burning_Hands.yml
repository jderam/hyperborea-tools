Desc: "<p>Jets of thin, multihued flames spring from the fingertips
of the caster’s enveloped-in-flames hands, fanning
out in a 120° horizontal arc and causing 2 hp damage
per CA level, with no saving throw allowed. Combustible
materials (e.g., cloth, paper, dry wood) are likely
ignited if exposed to <i>burning hands</i>.</p>"
