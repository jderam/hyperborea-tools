Desc: "<p>From the sorcerer’s hands emerges a rainbow of colours,
forming a wedge 5 feet wide at its base, 20 feet
long, and 20 feet wide at its terminus. <i>Colour spray</i>
affects 1d6 creatures within this area of effect, beginning
with those closest to the caster. Targets are allowed
<i>sorcery</i> saving throws. Victims of 5 HD or fewer that
fail their save are stricken unconscious for 2d4 rounds.
Victims of 6 HD or more that fail their saving throws
are blinded for 1d4 rounds. Blind creatures always lose
initiative and suffer −4 penalties on attack rolls, armour
class, and saving throws. <i>N.B.:</i> Undead, constructs, and
blind or sightless creatures are unaffected by this spell.</p>"
