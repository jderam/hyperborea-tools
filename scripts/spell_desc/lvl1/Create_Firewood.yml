Desc: "<p>Dry, seasoned, split firewood is conjured, a stack measuring
2 × 2 × 4 feet. At CA 5, this amount increases to
2 × 2 × 8 feet of stacked, split wood. The wood appears
on solid ground 10 feet in front of the caster’s outstretched
hands. If the firewood is not utilized within
48 hours, it disappears from whence it came.</p>"
