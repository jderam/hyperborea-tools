by +20 (maximum 70 MV) for the duration of the spell;
e.g., a character with 40 MV can move at 60 MV (120
feet per round running). The secondary effect of this
spell is marathon-like endurance: The runner can <i>dash</i>
for 1d4+2 hours before the spell ends, unless terminated
earlier by the caster or a <i>dispel magic</i> spell.</p>"
