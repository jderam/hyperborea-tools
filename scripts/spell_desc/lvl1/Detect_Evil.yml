Desc: "<p>The sorcerer detects potent emanations of Evil in a
60-foot-long, 10-foot-wide path. Sources of Evil emanations
might include Evil artefacts, dæmons, or the undead.
<i>Detect evil</i> will not discern the alignment of other
characters, even if they are Evil, unless the subject
is of a pure and intense Evil (empowered by dæmons,
for example) or is about to commit a most vile act.
Clerics must brandish their holy symbols to cast this
spell. From a stationary position the caster can slowly
rotate, covering 360° before the spell ends. <i>Detect evil</i>
is obstructed by metal of one-inch thickness, stone of
six-inch thickness, or wood of one-foot thickness; lead
completely foils the spell. Evil sorcerers cast the reverse
version of this spell, <i>detect good</i>, which functions
the same way with regard to emanations of Good.</p>"
