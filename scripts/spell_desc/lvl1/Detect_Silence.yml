Desc: "<p>Allows the caster to hear that which is magically
<i>silenced</i> or <i>moving silently</i> (thieves, barbarians, assassins,
et al.) in a 120-foot radius. The spell attunes the
caster to subtleties of sound otherwise imperceptible,
such as a whisper behind a closed door. If the caster
enters a deep trance, <i>detect silence</i> can also be used to
perceive noises made in parallel dimensions.</p>"
