Desc: "<p>The caster notices outdoor traps, including deadfalls,
pits, snares, and spring traps; even natural hazards
may be discerned. The path of detection is 30 feet
long and 10 feet wide. The sorcerer must continue to
concentrate, with hands spread wide. Walking is permitted,
but no jogging, running, or the like. Except for
pits, snares, and other simple traps as noted above,
this spell will not detect the sort of complex mechanical
or magical traps typically found in dungeons.</p>"
