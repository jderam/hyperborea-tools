Desc: "<p>This spell has two functions: First, it reveals if an ailing
person suffers the effects of poison, whether from
a trap, snakebite, spider venom, or the like. The second
function determines if a creature is venomous, or if an
object is laced or trapped with poison. The creature
or object in question must be viewed by the caster;
obstructions will preclude the spell from functioning.
From a stationary position the caster can slowly rotate,
covering 360Â° before the spell ends.</p>"
