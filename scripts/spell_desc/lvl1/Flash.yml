Desc: "<p>Requires one hour to cast, using the bladder of an ungulate
such as a cow, goat, or sheep. The spell creates
five small capsules of densely packed powder, each of
which can be hurled at a single creature. This is executed
by use of the <i>flask hurling</i> rules (see <b>Chapter 9:
Combat</b>, <i>combat options</i>). If a hit is scored, the capsule
explodes in a blinding <i>flash</i>, and the victim is blinded
for 1d4 rounds; a miss indicates failure, a small, ineffective
puff of smoke. Blind creatures always lose initiative
and suffer âˆ’4 penalties on attack rolls, armour
class, and saving throws.</p>"
