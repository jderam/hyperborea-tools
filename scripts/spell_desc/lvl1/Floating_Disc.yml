Desc: "<p>Causes a flat, shield-sized disc to materialize behind
the caster. The <i>floating disc</i> glides horizontally and
follows the caster at about waist level, remaining 6–10
feet behind and moving at the caster’s MV rate. The
<i>disc</i> can bear 500 pounds; anything greater will ground
it. When the spell ends, the <i>floating disc</i> disappears,
and anything it bore falls to the ground.</p>"
