Desc: "<p>This dweomer is placed upon a handful of fresh berries,
2d4 of which are enchanted to <i>goodberries</i>. The
berries must be no more than 5 days removed from the
branch, and they must be stored in a cool, dry place.
Only the caster knows which berries are enchanted,
though <i>detect magic</i> can also reveal them. A single
<i>goodberry</i> can nourish a person for a day or cure 1 hp
of damage; the choice a sort of mini-wish made by the
consumer. However, only eight healing berries can be
consumed by one person in a 24-hour period.</p>
<p>The reverse of this spell, <i>badberry</i>, must be cast on
spoilt or rotten berries. It makes them appear fresh.
These berries deliver mild poison to the consumer for
1 hp damage each, negated by a <i>death</i> (poison) saving
throw. If multiple <i>badberries</i> are consumed at the
same time, only one saving throw is allowed, though
the same maximum of eight <i>badberries</i> are effective
(thus 8 hp damage).</p>"
