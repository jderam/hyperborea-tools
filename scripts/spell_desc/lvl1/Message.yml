Desc: "<p>The sorcerer points at the recipient and whispers a
<i>message</i> that is heard as though the two stood side by
side. The recipient can then reply if the spellâ€™s duration
has not elapsed. The caster and the recipient must be
able to see each other. If the spell is cast at an unwilling
target, a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw can be made to block the
audibility of the spell.</p>"
