Desc: "<p>A visual illusion is created, a projected image of
nearly anything the caster can imagine, as large as
20 × 20 × 20 feet in area. Victims must be living creatures
of animal intelligence or greater; undead, constructs,
oozes, and the like are unaffected. <i>Phantasm</i>
can be used to create an attacking monster or another
damaging hazard, but the illusion is strictly of sight,
not of sound, smell, or temperature.</p>
<p>Once cast, this spell persists as long as the caster concentrates,
unless the illusion is touched or terminated
via a <i>dispel phantasm</i> spell. A <i>phantasmal</i> monster is
AC 9 and will disappear if hit; otherwise, it can continue
to attack as manipulated by the caster. The caster
can direct the illusion to move anywhere within the
spell’s range; such manoeuvres require complete concentration,
and no movement is allowed.</p>
<p><i>Phantasm</i> targets are not allowed saving throws unless
the referee feels the illusion is unbelievable to the
viewers, in which case <i>sorcery</i> saving throws should
be rolled, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.
Credibility may come into question because
of the soundlessness of the illusion (e.g., a charging
mammoth); in other instances, such as a <i>phantasm</i> of
fire, a lack of thermal properties can create suspicion.
To the eyes of the disbeliever, the <i>phantasm</i> becomes a
flawed and flickering transparent image. An intelligent
disbeliever may then alert allies, whose saves are made
at a bonus of +4. Otherwise, this illusion can inflict real
physical damage: 1d4 hp base damage, +1 hp damage
per CA level, per round to each victim. Such damage
remains even if the spell is subsequently broken.</p>"
