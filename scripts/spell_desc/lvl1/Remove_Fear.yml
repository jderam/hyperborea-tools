Desc: "<p>Grants the recipient steely resolve against the effects of
sorcerous fright. Cast as a preparatory spell, any fearbased
saving throws are made at +4 for 1 turn + 1 turn
per CA level. Cast on one who already suffers the effects
of fear, a new saving throw is allowed at a +2 bonus. The
reverse of this spell, <i>cause fear</i>, requires a touch attack.
If the target is struck and fails its <i>sorcery</i> saving throw,
modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable, it must
flee from the caster at maximum MV for 1 round per CA
level (or simply cower if cornered). <i>Cause fear</i> is broken
if the victim is attacked.</p>"
