Desc: "<p>By piping a flute, hypnotize as many as 2 HD of snakes
as the sorcerer has CA levels. The snakes stare at the
caster, some (usually cobras) posturing themselves
erect and swaying side to side. Slowly, the caster and
any allies can move away whilst the snakes remain
thus, though any violent or sudden movement will jar
them from the charm. The effectiveness of this spell
is predicated on the circumstances: An approaching
snake—even one with intent to attack—or a torpid or
otherwise unsuspecting snake is not allowed a saving
throw; the effects are automatic. Snakes that are already
engaged in combat are allowed <i>sorcery</i> saving
throws to resist.</p>"
