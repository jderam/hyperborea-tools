Desc: "<p>This spell requires 1 turn to cast and necessitates the
sacrifice of a 50-gp gem. It summons an invisible entity
of limited means. The <i>unseen servant</i> can clean, fetch
and carry a 10-pound item (or drag a 20-pound item),
tie a simple knot, mend a torn cloth or sack, open an
unlocked door, or perform other menial tasks throughout
the duration of the spell.</p>
<p>The entity cannot fight, though it is not easy to kill:
Magical weapons or spells must be used. The <i>unseen
servant</i> has the following statistics: <b>MV</b> 30 (but it
cannot run); <b>AC</b> 5; <b>HD</b> 1 (<b>hp</b> 6); <b>#A</b> 0; <b>D</b> â€”; <b>SV</b> 17.
If the caster moves farther than 120 feet away from
the <i>unseen servant</i>, it will disappear.</p>"
