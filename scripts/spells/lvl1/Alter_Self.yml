Desc: "<p>The sorcerer’s form is mutated to something or someone no more than 50% smaller or larger, lighter or heavier. The new form has quasi-actuality. For example, if the new form has wings, the caster is allowed minimal flight, moving at no greater than 50% of the actual creature’s speed; if the creature has gills, the caster can breathe underwater; and so on. The altered form is limited to humans, humanoids, or other bipedal species with which the caster is familiar. This spell does not grant any special abilities beyond locomotion and respiration—no innate magical abilities, no enhanced acuity. The duration of the spell should be rolled in secret by the referee.</p>"
