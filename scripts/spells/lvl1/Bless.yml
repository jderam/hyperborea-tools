Desc: "<p>All allies within 25 feet of the caster are sanctified by
this spell, gaining a +1 to any saving throw versus fear
effects (whether <i>sorcery</i> or <i>device</i>), and a +1 bonus on all
attack rolls. Furthermore, NPCs (henchmen, hirelings,
etc.) each gain a +1 bonus on any <i>morale</i> (ML) check.</p>
<p>The reverse form of this spell, <i>blight</i>, curses all hostile
creatures within 25 feet of the caster, effecting −1
morale, −1 on saving throws versus fear effects, and a
−1 penalty on all attack rolls. <i>N.B.:</i> Either form of this
spell affects only those within range at the moment the
spell is cast; i.e., subsequently moving into or out of
range has no bearing on the spell’s effects.</p>"
