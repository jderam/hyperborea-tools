Desc: "<p>The target of this spell (human, humanoid, or giant)
must make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. If the save fails, the
victim views the caster as a close and trusted comrade
to be protected and defended for the duration of the
spell. If the ensorcelled victim understands the caster’s
language, the caster can “suggest” the victim perform
various tasks, so long as they are not diametrically opposite
to the victim’s nature.</p>
<p>The spell <i>dispel magic</i> can cancel this spell. Otherwise,
additional <i>sorcery</i> saving throws (<i>willpower adjustment</i>
applies) are allowed to break the spell at a time
predicated on the targets intelligence (IN) score.:</p>
<ul><li>13–18 IN = new save every 6 turns</li>
<li>9–12 IN = new save every 24 hours</li>
<li>3–8 IN = new save once per week</li></ul>"
