Desc: "<p>A violet glow emanates from the hands of the sorcerer.
The next foe struck (bare hand or a melee weapon) sustains
an additional 1d4 hp of energy-sapping damage,
followed by a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw. If the saving throw
fails, the victim is weakened, suffering penalties of −1
on attack and damage rolls for the spell’s duration. The
dweomer fades if the caster does not strike a foe before
the spell expires.</p>"
