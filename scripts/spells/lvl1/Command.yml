single word of <i>command</i>, a word the victim is compelled
to obey. The caster and victim must understand
the same language, and the <i>command</i> must be clear.
Typical <i>commands</i> include “Die!”, “Fall!”, “Flee!”,
“Jump!”, “Sit!”, “Sleep!”, and “Stop!” The victim will
not actually die if commanded to do so but may fall and
enter a state of unconsciousness, unless disturbed.</p>"
