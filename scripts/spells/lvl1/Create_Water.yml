Desc: "<p>The sorcerer conjures as much as three gallons of
water per CA level. The water is fresh, clean, and potable.
It can be placed within one or more appropriate
containers so long as they are touching, or it can be
evoked to appear in the air within the spellâ€™s range.
The reverse of this spell, <i>destroy water</i>, vaporizes a
like amount of water. If used offensively (e.g., several
gallons of water dropped on the head of an enemy),
the target is allowed an <i>avoidance</i> saving throw.</p>"
