Desc: "<p>Effects 1d4+2 bouncing flames that simulate a marching
group of torch-bearing patrollers. With a word,
the caster can direct the <i>dancing lights</i> to move, even
around corners, though only within the range of the
spell; if guided otherwise, they will disappear. Directing
a <i>dancing lights</i> spell does not require continued
concentration, but simply a flick of the hand or finger.</p>"
