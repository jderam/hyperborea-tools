Desc: "<p>Evokes magical blackness to consume a 15-foot radius
from its selected target point. Torch and lantern light
are rendered ineffective, and <i>infrared vision</i> is futile.
If <i>darkness</i> is cast on an unwilling creature, a <i>sorcery</i>
saving throw is allowed to negate the spell. Creatures
affected by <i>darkness</i> suffer effects similar to blindness:
automatic loss of initiative and âˆ’4 penalties on attack
rolls, armour class, and saving throws. <i>Darkness</i> can
counter <i>continuous light</i> and <i>light</i>.</p>"
