Desc: "<p>Allows the caster to sense the presence of magic items
or other dweomered persons, places, or things (e.g.,
an enchanted treasure chest, a <i>sorcerer locked</i> door).
The dweomered items will glow before the eyes of the
caster in a path of detection 60 feet long and 10 feet
wide. From a stationary position the caster can slowly
rotate, covering 360Â° before the spell ends. <i>Detect magic</i>
is obstructed by metal of one-inch thickness, stone
of six-inch thickness, or wood of one-foot thickness;
lead always masks the presence of magic.</p>"
