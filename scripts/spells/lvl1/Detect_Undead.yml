Desc: "<p>In a 60-foot-long, 10-foot-wide path, the caster
discerns the presence of lesser undead creatures
(<i>Undead Types 0–5</i>). Casters of CA 7 or greater will
detect any undead creature. The detected abominations
will glow a putrid green before the eyes of the
caster. From a stationary position the caster can slowly
rotate, covering 360° before the spell ends. <i>Detect
undead</i> is obstructed by metal of one-inch thickness,
stone of six-inch thickness, or wood of one-foot thickness;
lead completely foils the spell.</p>"
