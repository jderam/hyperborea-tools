Desc: "<p>Illusion is used to transform the sorcerer’s appearance
(including garb and gear) to something or someone
else of similar size and shape. One can appear up to
one foot taller or shorter and/or 25% heavier or lighter.
The sorcerer can also assume the general look and
shape of any familiar human or humanoid, though not
of a specific being. The variable duration of the spell
should be rolled secretly by the referee, the glamour
ending abruptly upon the spell’s termination.</p>"
