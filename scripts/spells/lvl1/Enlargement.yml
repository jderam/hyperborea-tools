Desc: "<p>Induces unnatural growth in a single object or creature,
augmenting ×1.5 the size and mass of organic
matter, or augmenting ×2 the size and mass of inorganic
matter. <i>Enlarged</i> creatures gain a +50% damage
bonus to all attacks (attack damage totalled and then
multiplied ×1.5). For objects, the area of effect is limited
to 10 cubic feet per CA level; e.g., a CA 10 caster can
double the size of an earthen mound not exceeding 100
cubic feet in initial volume. This spell will not increase
the magical nature of any object: A portcullis can be
swollen shut, a dagger can be doubled to a short sword,
but an enlarged <b>potion of healing</b> does not become
the equivalent of two potions. The reverse of this spell,
<i>reduction</i>, halves the size and mass of a creature or object
(no more than 10 cubic feet per CA level). Affected
creatures suffer a −50% damage penalty on all attacks
(attack damage totalled and then halved). Unwilling
creatures are allowed <i>transformation</i> saving throws
to resist <i>enlargement</i> or <i>reduction</i>.</p>"
