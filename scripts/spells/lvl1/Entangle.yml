Desc: "<p>Plants and underbrush are enchanted to entwine and
entrap all creatures that fail an <i>avoidance</i> saving throw
within a 20-foot radius of the target point. Any creature
that subsequently enters the enchanted area during the
spellâ€™s duration is likewise subject to its effects. Bushes,
grasses, shrubs, and even small trees spring to life,
ensnaring and twisting about the victims; if these are
scant or nonexistent, then the spell is ineffective. Those
who make the save may move at half MV to negotiate a
path out from the enchanted flora. Exceptionally large
or robust creatures save at +4, or they might be unaffected
by this spell, as judged by the referee. <i>Entangled</i>
spell casters may be required to make an <i>extraordinary
feat of dexterity</i> in order to cast a spell.</p>"
