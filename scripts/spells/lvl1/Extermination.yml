Desc: "<p>Eradicates rodents and vermin in a 1 × 1 × 1 foot
area per CA level (e.g., a CA 5 sorcerer can affect a
5 × 5 × 5-foot area). Flies, mosquitoes, mice, ordinary
beetles, centipedes, and spiders instantly are killed by this
spell; Small animals of ¼ HD (e.g., bats, rats, small birds)
are allowed <i>death</i> saving throws. <i>Extermination</i> slays
two Small animals (¼ HD apiece) per CA level, so a
CA 2 sorcerer may slay 4 bats upon uttering this spell.</p>"
