Desc: "<p>Plumes of thin, blue-white frost spring from the fingertips
of the caster, fanning out in a 120Â° horizontal
arc and causing 2 hp damage per CA level, with no
saving throw allowed. Small fires can be extinguished
by <i>freezing hands</i>. Modest quantities of water, wine, or
ale can be frozen, but liquids of higher alcohol content
will be unaffected.</p>"
