Desc: "<p>The caster’s charisma score is improved by 2d4 points
(to 18 maximum). Creatures who speak with the caster
must make immediate <i>reaction rolls</i>, modified by the
<i>reaction/loyalty adjustment</i> of the sorcerer’s improved
charisma score. If the result is favourable (score of 9+),
the caster is at once viewed as a charming and impressive
person worthy of help, consideration, and support.
The caster is convincing to those who are affected, so
long as he or she is not overly abrasive. Once the spell’s
duration has expired, those who were influenced by the
caster will realize they were ensorcelled.</p>"
