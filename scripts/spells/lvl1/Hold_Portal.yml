Desc: "<p>Magically secures a door, gate, or the like. A <i>dispel
magic</i> spell negates it, a <i>knock</i> spell opens it, or a
strong person or monster might break it down: 1-in-12
chance for 17 ST, 1-in-6 chance for 18 ST. Too, a character
with the <i>open locks</i> special ability can attempt
to disrupt the <i>hold portal</i> spell using thievesâ€™ tools;
however, the chance-in-twelve of success is reduced by
2. Lastly, <i>hold portal</i> can be bypassed by any magician
(or magician subclass) whose CA is at least 3 levels
greater than the one who placed the dweomer. The
duration of the spell should be rolled in secret by the
referee.</p>"
