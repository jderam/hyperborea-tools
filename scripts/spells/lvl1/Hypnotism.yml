Desc: "<p>The sorcerer’s eyes become kaleidoscopic as he or she
makes weird, mesmerizing gestures and speaks in low,
reverberating tones. The sorcerer can <i>hypnotize</i> 1d6
selected creatures. Targets are allowed <i>sorcery</i> saving
throws to resist; the saves are modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. Hostile (i.e., already on the
attack) creatures gain a +2 bonus on their saving
throws. <i>Hypnotized</i> creatures might be convinced
to take some simple course of action (uttered by the
sorcerer in a brief sentence), but it cannot be a self-destructive
action or the connexion will be broken. The
caster may utter this proposition at any time after the
<i>hypnosis</i> takes effect, though before the spell’s duration
elapses; once the spell ends, all effects terminate.</p>"
