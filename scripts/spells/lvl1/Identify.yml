Desc: "<p>This ritual requires 6 turns (1 hour) to cast in a peaceful
environment and necessitates the sacrifice of 100 gp
worth of treasure (e.g., gold, gems) per item <i>identified</i>.
The spell enables the caster to perceive the magical
properties of one magic item per CA level, each item
requiring 1 turn to properly <i>identify</i>. Note that whereas
the properties of a magic item can be <i>identified</i>, the
charges of a wand or like item may not be reckoned,
and the exact description of such magical properties
is always at the refereeâ€™s discretion. This ritual is exhausting;
consequently, the caster will suffer a temporary
8-point constitution drain until appropriate rest is
taken. One point of constitution is restored per hour. If
the constitution loss results in a score of 3 or less, the
caster will fall unconscious for 24 hours.</p>"
