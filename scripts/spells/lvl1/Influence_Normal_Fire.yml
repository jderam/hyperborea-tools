Desc: "<p>Allows the caster to affect non-magical fires from as
small as a torch to as large as a three-foot-diameter
bonfire. With a wave of the hand, a fire may be doubled
or shrunk to the size of a lit match. The fireâ€™s fuel consumption
is influenced by the spell, but heat output is
not. Normal fire causes 1d4 damage per round to those
who are directly exposed to the flames. If, for example,
a bonfire is doubled, and enemies are huddled around
it, each may make an <i>avoidance</i> save to escape harm.</p>"
