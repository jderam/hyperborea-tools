Desc: "<p>Causes undead to completely ignore the subject; living
creatures are unaffected. The recipient remains invisible
to undead until the spell is cancelled or <i>dispelled</i>, or
if the subject harms another creature—be it undead or
not. (In this instance, “harm” is defined as any action
that would directly cause damage to another creature.)
The recipient of this spell cannot <i>turn undead</i>. Intelligent
undead creatures of 10 or more HD can make <i>sorcery</i>
saving throws if the spell’s recipient approaches
within 30 feet; if successful, they will discern the spell’s
recipient as an apparition of sorts.</p>"
