Desc: "<p>Allows the recipient to leap 40 feet forwards (with a
10-foot apex), 10 feet backwards, or 20 feet straight up.
For every additional 3 CA levels of the sorcerer, the
affected can make another <i>jump</i>; thus, a CA 4 sorcerer
can empower two such <i>jumps</i>, a CA 7 sorcerer can empower
three, and a CA 10 sorcerer four, so long as all
<i>jumps</i> occur before the spellâ€™s expiration.</p>"
