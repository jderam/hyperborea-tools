Desc: "<p>Effects a 30-foot-diameter sphere of soft, lambent illuminance,
somewhat dimmer than full daylight. The spell
can be centred on an object, on a person, or in the air. If
<i>light</i> is centred on the visual organs of a creature, and it
fails a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, the victim is partially blinded
for the duration of the spell, suffering −2 “to hit,” −2
AC, and −2 saving throws. This spell can be ended at
will by the caster. A <i>light</i> spell can counter a <i>darkness</i>
spell, and vice versa, but not <i>continuous darkness</i>.</p>"
