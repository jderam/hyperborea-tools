Desc: "<p>The sorcerer selects a known animal type to be found
(e.g., bear, eagle, wolf). The type must be well known
by the caster; another person describing the animal
type is insufficient (though a detailed picture may
suffice), and magical or supernatural creatures do not
qualify. If an animal of the stated type is indeed within
range of the spell, the caster will know which direction
to seek, but not the precise distance.</p>"
