Desc: "<p>Detects the presence of deceased creatures in a
30-foot radius. The caster walks at half speed, chanting,
gesticulating, and attuning to the presence of
death. Although <i>locate the dead</i> can detect the presence
of undead creatures, it does not distinguish between
death and undeath. This spell penetrates 10 feet
of packed earth, five feet of wood, three feet of stone,
or one inch of metal (except lead). <i>Locate the dead</i> also
can be used to seek a specific dead person or creature;
however, the caster must possess a personal item or
memento of the sought-after corpse.</p>"
