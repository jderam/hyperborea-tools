Desc: "<p>Cyan-glowing icicles form in the hand of the caster and
fire at single target for 1d6+1 hp damage. For every
CA level, the sorcerer can fire an equal amount of magic
ice darts (i.e., one at CA 1, two at CA 2, three at CA 3,
and so forth). All missiles are fired at once, though each
requires a separate attack roll, modified by dexterity
<i>attack modifier</i>, if applicable. Cryomancers (but not
other sorcerers) gain +1 “to hit” for every 2 CA levels
(i.e., CA 1–2 = +1, CA 3–4 = +2, and so forth). <i>N.B.:</i> If
using the optional <i>critical hits and misses</i> rules, each
<i>magic ice dart</i> is subject to critical success or failure.</p>"
