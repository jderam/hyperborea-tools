a sling). Each stone issues a sharp report upon impact.
For every 3 CA levels one stone is enchanted:</p>

<p><i>Magic stones</i> can be launched with a sling or hurled as
normal stones by the caster or an ally. Only one stone
can be hurled at a time unless the target is no more
than 10 feet away, in which case multiple stones may be
hurled. Once a <i>magic stone</i> is tossed, its enchantment
is lost, whether it strikes its intended target or not. If
a sorcerer is struck by a <i>magic stone</i> whilst casting a
spell, the spell is disrupted, even if the optional <i>concentration
check</i> is in play, and spell loss is automatic.</p>"
