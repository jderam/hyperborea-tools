Desc: "<p>Causes ice or hard-packed snow to thaw, liquescing a
volume equal to 10 cubic feet per CA level. Each 10
cubic feet of ice requires 1 round to melt. So, a 5th-level
sorcerer can thaw a sheet of ice that measures
50 × 1 × 1 feet, or 25 × 2 × 1 feet, and it would take
5 rounds to complete. If <i>melt ice</i> is cast under the feet
of an opponent, the victim is allowed an <i>avoidance</i> saving
throw to elude the melting area.</p>"
