Desc: "<p>Casting this spell requires 1 turn. The sorcerer must
whistle an incantation, thus calling forth a tiny bird
such as a finch, sparrow, or titmouse. The arriving bird
is afforded a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw (17 or greater roll
required; 18 if the sorcerer’s charisma is 13+). If the
save succeeds, the bird flies away; if it fails, the bird will
perch on the hand or shoulder of the sorcerer and remain
for the duration of the spell, acting on the caster’s
behalf. The caster can assign it a simple task or affix to
its leg a small note to be delivered; the recipient cannot
use the <i>messenger bird</i> to reply. This spell does not
confer the ability to converse with the summoned bird,
but uncannily it understands the wishes of the caster,
forming a picture in its mind of the recipient and location;
however, the task cannot be overly complex. Time,
not distance, is the limiting factor, as the bird can fly at
about 80 MV (48 miles per day). Once the spell terminates,
the bird will resume its normal activity.</p>"
