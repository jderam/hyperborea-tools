Desc: "<p>A round, shimmering mirror appears before the caster,
reflecting the gaze of any creature that uses its eyes
to attack or beguile. Such gaze attacks are reflected
at the gazer, and if the gazer does not make a saving
throw (<i>sorcery</i> or <i>transformation</i>, as the case may be),
it becomes a victim of its own devices. If the sorcerer’s
CA is 5 or more, a subtler version of the spell may be
cast: Sometimes called <i>mirror eyes</i>, this alternative
form causes the caster’s eyes to become mirrored for
the duration of the spell.</p>"
