Desc: "<p>Evokes 1d4+1 illusory duplicates of the sorcerer.
Each <i>mirror image</i> is indistinguishable from the caster.
Each is AC 9, modified by the <i>defence adjustment</i>
of the caster, if applicable; each dissipates if struck.
When the caster is attacked, the referee must assign
a probability by which the <i>mirror images</i> have
an equal chance to be targeted. For example, if two
<i>images</i> appear, a d6 may be used: <i>1–2</i> = the caster;
<i>3–4</i> = <i>image</i> one; <i>5–6</i> = <i>image</i> two. The <i>images</i> duplicate
the movements of the caster and appear to switch
places with one another, so even in melee the caster is
indistinguishable from the duplicates.</p>"
