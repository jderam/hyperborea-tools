Desc: "<p>A tame <b>riding horse</b> or <b>camel</b> (caster’s choice) is summoned,
the beast serving the caster for the duration
(unless killed) before disappearing whence it came. On
a 2-in-6 chance, the creature arrives with saddle and
harness; in such cases, a distinct possibility exists that
a rider somewhere in Hyperborea has been temporarily
deprived of his or her steed. Dead or alive, the mount
will return whence it came. Rolled in secret by the
referee, there exists a 1% chance that the owner of a
stolen <i>mount</i> may have the means and/or wherewithal
to divine the identity of the “borrower.”</p>"
