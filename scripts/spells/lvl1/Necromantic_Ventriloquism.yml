Desc: "<p>The voice of the sorcerer is thrown from the corpse
of a dead human, <b>skeleton</b>, or <b>zombie</b> that is within
range. The thrown voice is not that of the caster, but
simulates that which a dead or undead creature might
issue; i.e., a cold, raspy skeletal timbre, or a gurgling,
maggot-infested resonance.</p>"
