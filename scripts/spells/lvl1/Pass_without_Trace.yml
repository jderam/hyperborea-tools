Desc: "<p>The recipient of this spell can move through wilderness
terrain—be it forest, desert, or snowy mountainside—
without leaving a footprint, a scent, or other trace,
regardless of armour worn. A tracker has no chance
to find a trail; however, should one cast <i>detect magic</i>,
a faint trail of magical footprints will be discerned,
enduring for 6 turns (1 hour) after the spell’s recipient
has passed.</p>"
