Desc: "<p>Allows the caster to determine if one creature per CA
level within range pretends to be something it is not,
whether via sorcery or artifice. The spell will not reveal
the exact nature of the creature; neither will it detect
alignment or allow the caster to glean any additional
information, but merely that the target is not what it
feigns to be. Targets of this subtle spell are almost always
unaware that sorcery is at work. Each, however,
is allowed a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw to resist the spell.</p>"
