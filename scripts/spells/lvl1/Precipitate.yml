Desc: "<p>Cast outdoors under an at least partly cloudy sky, this
spell involves a chanting ritual that requires 1 turn to
complete. The spell invokes the clouds to release their
water vapour for the duration of the spell. The heaviness
and consistency of the rain depend on the cloud
cover and the prevailing temperature; hence, <i>precipitation</i>
could be sleet if the temperature is at or near
freezing, or snow if below freezing.</p>"
