Desc: "<p>The illusionist creates a glowing, palm-sized sphere
of energy based on one of the seven colours of the
visible spectrum. The <i>prismatic orb</i> may be hurled
up to 30 feet at a single foe. This functions as a missile
attack roll with a bonus +2 “to hit” against the
target’s armour class. The colour of orb conjured is
determined randomly by a d8; a result of <i>8</i> indicates
a special orb that cycles rapidly between two colours,
delivering the effects of both colours.</p>

<caption><b>Table 107: Prismatic Orb Effects</b></caption>
<tr><th>d8 Result</th> <th>Prismatic Orb Effect</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td> <td>Red orb that inflicts 1 hp of burning damage
per CA level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td> <td>Orange orb that inflicts 2 hp burning damage
per CA level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td>
<td>Yellow orb that partially blinds the visual
organs of the target as per a <i>light</i> spell
(−2 “to hit,” −2 AC, and −2 saving throws;
<i>sorcery</i> saving throw negates); duration is
1d2 + CA level in rounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td>
<td>Green orb that sickens target for 2d4
rounds unless a <i>death</i> (poison) save is made;
–2 “to hit” and saving throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td>
<td>Blue orb that inflicts effects similar to a <i>chill
touch</i> spell; <i>sorcery</i> saving throw or victim
suffers 1d4 hp of energy-sapping damage
and is penalized –1 “to hit” and damage rolls
for 1d2 + CA level in rounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td>
<td>Indigo orb that causes the target to wander
about confused for 1d6 rounds; <i>sorcery</i> saving
throw modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>
(if applicable) negates the spell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td>
<td>Violet orb that shoves the target with 10
pounds of force per CA level (cf. <i>shove</i>
spell) unless a <i>sorcery</i> save is made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td> <td>Two colours: Roll twice, ignoring results of 8.</td></tr>

<p>A <i>prismatic orb</i> may not be hurled through barriers
and will return to the caster’s palm up to three times
if it misses its intended target; however, each time it
returns to the caster’s palm, a (possibly) new colour(s)
takes form; i.e., a d8 must be rolled again. A returned
orb must be hurled on the next round or it disappears.</p>"
