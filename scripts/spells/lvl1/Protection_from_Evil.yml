Desc: "<p>A pale circle of light surrounds the caster, preventing
summoned creatures (e.g., d√¶mons, elementals) from
attacking. Against other Evil creatures, the sorcerer
enjoys a +1 bonus to AC, DR, and saving throws versus
their attacks. The reverse of this spell, <i>protection
from good</i>, can be cast only by Evil or Neutral sorcerers;
it functions the same way, except versus creatures
of Good alignment.</p>"
