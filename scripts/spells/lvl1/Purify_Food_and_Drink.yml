Desc: "<p>Decontaminates one cubic foot of spoilt or rotten foodstuffs
per CA level. Even poisonous food is made pure
by this spell. The reverse of this spell, <i>putrefy food
and drink</i>, spoils and rots an equal amount of food and
drink; it cannot make food “poisonous,” but putrefied
food may well sicken a consumer.</p>"
