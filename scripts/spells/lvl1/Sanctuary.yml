Desc: "<p>Persuades opponents to ignore the caster if they fail
their <i>sorcery</i> saving throws, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. The caster can move about
freely, taking other inoffensive actions until the spell’s
duration terminates. However, <i>sanctuary</i> provides no
special protection if the caster happens to be in the area
of effect of an enemy sorcerer’s spell (e.g., <i>entangle</i>,
<i>fireball</i>), such as when a nearby ally is targeted. Any
offensive actions taken by the caster (physical attacks,
harmful spells, or the like) break the spell.</p>"
