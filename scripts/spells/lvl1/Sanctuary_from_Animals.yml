Desc: "<p>Persuades animals to ignore the caster completely if
they fail their <i>sorcery</i> saving throws. The caster can
move about freely, taking other inoffensive actions
until the spell’s duration terminates. However, <i>sanctuary
from animals</i> provides no special protection if the
caster happens to be in the area of effect of an animal’s
special attack (e.g., a <b>giant ferret’s</b> musk), such as
when a nearby ally is targeted. Any offensive actions
taken by the caster (physical attacks, harmful spells,
or the like) break the spell.</p>"
