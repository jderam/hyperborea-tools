Desc: "<p>A spell to frighten an opponent. The caster can direct
the spell at but one creature, which is allowed a <i>sorcery</i>
saving throw, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.
If the save fails, the victim enters a state of
utter fear, at once cowering and trembling uncontrollably.
If attacked or cornered, however, the frightened
creature will fight back, though at a −1 “to hit” until
the spell ends. Undead and other creatures devoid of
emotion are unaffected by this spell.</p>"
