Desc: "<p>The sorcerer touches a target, unleashing a jolt of
electricity that delivers 1d8 hp damage, +1 hp per CA
level (so a CA 3 sorcerer delivers 1d8+3 hp damage).
The sorcerer must be able to touch the victim or a
reasonable conductor in contact with the victim. If the
sorcerer’s attack is a miss, subsequent attempts may
be made in the following rounds of combat, but any action
other than half movement breaks the spell. <i>N.B.:</i>
Metal armour is ignored when calculating the victim’s
armour class, if applicable.</p>"
