Desc: "<p>Evokes an invisible force to push a creature or object.
The caster discharges 10 pounds of force per CA level.
Inanimate objects do not gain saving throws but
might not be affected depending on their weight and
mass, as judged by the referee. A targeted creature is
allowed a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw to negate the effects of
this spell. An affected target is pushed five feet, plus
one foot per CA level. Generally, 20–30 pounds of force
will push a Small creature, 40–60 pounds of force will
push a Medium creature, and 70+ pounds of force will
push a Large creature. Of course, common sense must
prevail; e.g., an <b>albino ape</b> may be pushed back by
90 pounds of force, but <b>woolly mammoths</b> and other
huge creatures are unlikely to be moved.</p>"
