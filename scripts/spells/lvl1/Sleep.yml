Desc: "<p>Induces victims of 4 HD or fewer to slumber, with no
saving throws possible. This enchantment encompasses
a 30-foot-diameter area and affects 2d8 HD of creatures,
starting with the lowest HD creatures first. Note
that any “+” to hit dice should be ignored when determining
the HD value of affected targets (e.g., a 3+1 HD
creature counts as 3 HD, though a 3 HD creature will be
ensorcelled before a 3+1 HD creature). Alternatively,
this spell can be targeted at a single creature of 5 HD
or fewer. <i>Sleeping</i> victims will not awaken from normal
noise, though they will rouse if shaken or slapped. Undead
and constructs are unaffected by this spell.</p>"
