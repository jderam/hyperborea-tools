Desc: "<p>A dense cloud of smoke forms, occupying an area
of 8,000 cubic feet (e.g., a 20 × 20 × 20-foot room, a
10 × 10 × 80-foot passage). The sorcerer can stand in
the centre of the <i>smoke cloud</i>, casting the spell in such
a way that it extends in all directions, but any movement
will place the sorcerer in the smoke. The cloud
induces mild coughing and irritates the eyes of those
within its confines. <i>Smoke cloud</i> also obstructs vision:
Missiles may be fired 10 feet into it at a −4 penalty, but
longer ranges are impossible; melee within the smoke
cloud is likewise at −4 “to hit.”</p>"
