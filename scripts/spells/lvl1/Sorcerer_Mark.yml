Desc: "<p>The sorcerer etches a magical rune on a surface such
as leather, paper, wood, stone, or even metal. The rune
can be the personal symbol of the caster, or the sorcerer
can effect a magical inscription of no more than
seven words, plus one word per CA level; this lettering
may be read by one who can <i>read magic</i>. Alternatively,
the sorcerer can scribe an invisible <i>sorcerer mark</i> or
inscription, but such is revealed by <i>detect magic</i> or
<i>detect invisibility</i>.</p>"
