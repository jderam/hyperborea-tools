Desc: "<p>Allows the sorcerer to communicate with any normal
sort of animal (not magical beasts, monsters, or other
supernatural creatures). The animals will reply in kind;
such responses are usually limited to brief one- or twoword
statements predicated on the intelligence of the
animal, at the refereeâ€™s discretion. Friendly animals
might be convinced to perform some minor service.</p>"
