Desc: "<p>Allows the spellâ€™s recipient to scale sheer or vertical
surfaces, including those that are smooth and polished,
like marble. The fingertips and toes of the climber become
sticky, like those of a spider, with magical cilia
providing adhesion. A <i>spider climb</i> recipient can climb
up walls and move along ceilings at one-half their normal
movement rate. Whilst climbing, the recipient cannot
manipulate objects that weigh less than one pound
because such objects will cling to the hands. Spell
casters cannot cast other spells, but they can trigger
magical devices. <i>N.B.:</i> Gauntlets and heavy footwear
must be removed to benefit from this spell.</p>"
