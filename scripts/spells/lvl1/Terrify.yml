Desc: "<p>The fears of the subject (human, humanoid, or giant
only) are exploited by this enchantment. Eye contact
must be established, and a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified
by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable, allows one
to resist the spell’s effects.</p>
<p>A subject who fails the saving throw imagines the caster
as something that is poignantly malefic in a personal
way. This menace could be the monster of childhood
nightmares, or some other horror from the subject’s
past—something that compels a phobic reaction. The
caster must pretend to approach the victim in a deliberate
and threatening manner despite not knowing
what the victim imagines. The <i>terrified</i> will flee for
the duration of the spell, and if cornered, will simply
cringe in fear; if a cowering subject is attacked, the
spell is broken.</p>"
