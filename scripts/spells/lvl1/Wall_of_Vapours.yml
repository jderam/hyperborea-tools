Desc: "<p>Evokes a hedge of Æthereal mists as large as
10 × 30 × 30 feet in volume. These <i>vapours</i> are opaque
and normal sight cannot penetrate them; likewise, <i>infrared
vision</i> is blocked. The <i>wall of vapours</i>, however,
is easily dispersed. A <i>gust of wind</i> spell, or any natural
wind of 10 mph or greater, will diffuse the effect. The
cryomancer version of this spell generates a mist of ice
crystals.</p>"
