Desc: "<p>Allows the sorcerer to transfer a spell from one spell
book to another. The caster need not comprehend the
spell being transferred, but it must be a spell from the
sorcerer’s respective spell list. Once a spell is transferred,
it disappears from its original volume. Completing
this spell requires 6 turns (1 hour) per spell
level and necessitates sorcerer’s ink (such as sepia), a
fine quill, and a crushed gem of 100-gp value or greater.
Upon completing the transfer, the sorcerer must make
a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw or suffer 1d4 hp damage and
be knocked unconscious for 1d4 turns. If the sorcerer
is disrupted whilst performing this ritual, the transferred
spell will be lost, ruined.</p>"
