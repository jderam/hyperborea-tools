Desc: "<p>A magic arrow darts from the finger of the caster. On
a successful attack roll (<i>dexterity</i> modifier applies), the
<i>acid arrow</i> strikes for 1d4+1 hp physical damage, plus
an additional 2d4 hp acid damage in the same round.
Magicians (but not other sorcerers) enjoy a +1 bonus
to the attack roll for every 2 CA levels (CA 3–4 = +2,
CA 5–6 = +3, and so forth). Acid damage will persist
for higher level sorcerers:</p>
<ul><li>1 extra round for CA 4–6</li>
<li>2 extra rounds for CA 7–9</li>
<li>3 extra rounds for CA 10 or greater.</li></ul>
<p>For example, an <i>acid arrow</i> fired by a CA 12 sorcerer
on round 1 would inflict 1d4+1 hp base damage plus
2d4 hp acid damage on round 1, 2d4 hp acid damage
on round 2, 2d4 hp acid damage on round 3, and a final
2d4 hp acid damage on round 4. The acid may ruin armour
or clothing per referee discretion. <i>N.B.:</i> If using
the optional <i>critical hits and misses</i> rules, <i>acid arrow</i>
is subject to critical success or failure; however, magicians
should use the “fighter” column in each such
instance. Also, any multiplied damage that results
from a critical hit or critical miss applies strictly to the
arrow’s physical damage, not the acid.</p>"
