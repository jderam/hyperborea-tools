throw versus fear effects (whether <i>sorcery</i> or <i>device</i>),
a +1 bonus on all attack rolls, and a temporary 1d8
hit point boost. These hit points may exceed the recipientâ€™s
normal hp maximum. Any subsequent damage
is drawn from the temporary hp first, the remainder
disappearing when the spell ends. Lastly, if cast upon
an NPC ally (henchman, hireling, etc.), the recipient
gains a +1 bonus on any <i>morale</i> (ML) check.</p>"
