Desc: "<p>Through communion with otherworldly agents, the
sorcerer learns whether an action in the near future
(within 3 turns) will be advantageous or disadvantageous.
The caster must clearly and concisely articulate
the considered action (or inaction, as it were) through
prayer and cogitation over a 1-turn period. The referee
then informs the player if the proposed action is for
weal, for woe, or inconsequential. The chance to successfully
divine the future is 7-in-10, which should be
rolled secretly by the referee; a failed result yields an
inaccurate <i>augury</i>.</p>"
