Desc: "<p>The sorcerer fascinates the subject of this spell if it
fails its <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. The <i>captivated</i> creature
sees the caster as pleasing, desirable, or ideal. The
sorcerer can direct the <i>captivated</i> one, who will trust,
follow, and obey the caster. However, every time a new
request is made, no matter how small or large, the victim
of the spell rolls 3d6. If the total exceeds the caster’s
charisma score, the spell is broken. Furthermore,
if the request is unreasonable or potentially harmful to
the victim, the roll may be made with a bonus of +1 to
+3, as judged by the referee. If the spell is broken, the
subject will be filled with unbridled rage, attacking the
caster at +2 “to hit” and damage rolls.</p>
<p>Normal animals also are subject to the <i>captivate</i> spell
and will follow the caster for 1d4 days. If the animal
is of a sort that might be tamed, and if it has been fed
and treated well, it becomes a loyal ally if a 3d6 roll
does not exceed the caster’s charisma score. It will,
however, resent other animal companions.</p>"
