Desc: "<p>The subject is blinded unless a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw is
successful. The afflicted sees grey and nothing more,
the tone of which depends on how much light is present.
This spell is permanent unless dismissed by the
caster. It can be negated by the spells <i>cure blindness</i>
or <i>dispel magic</i>. Blind creatures always lose initiative
and suffer âˆ’4 penalties on attack rolls, armour class,
and saving throws.</p>"
