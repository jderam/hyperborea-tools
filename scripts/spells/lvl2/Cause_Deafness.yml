Desc: "<p>The subject is deafened unless a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw
is successful. This spell is permanent unless dismissed
by the caster. It can be negated by the spells <i>cure deafness</i>
or <i>dispel magic</i>. A deaf creature is surprized on
a base 4-in-6 chance and suffers an individual initiative
penalty of −2 (i.e., the deaf creature may lose initiative,
despite its allies winning). Other penalties may
apply, at the referee’s discretion.</p>"
