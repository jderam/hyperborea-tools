Desc: "<p>Cloaks the recipient with semi-transparency that blends
with the colour and texture of the recipient’s surroundings
for the spell’s duration. <i>Chameleon</i> extends to the
clothes/armour worn and gear carried by the spell’s
recipient, but a rope or other lengthy item will become
visible beyond five feet. If the subject removes an object,
that object will no longer blend with its surroundings.</p>
<p>An undetected <i>chameleon</i> subject gains a 2-in-6 bonus
to surprize opponents and gains +2 “to hit” for all
initial attack rolls (i.e., first attack for each encounter).
Furthermore, if perfectly still and not in direct
sunlight, the subject can successfully <i>hide</i> as a thief,
with automatic success. <i>Chameleon</i> recipients can be
revealed via <i>infrared vision</i> or <i>detect invisibility</i>.</p>"
