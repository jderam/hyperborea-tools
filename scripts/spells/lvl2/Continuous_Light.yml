Desc: "<p>Creates a 60-foot-diameter sphere of lambent light,
the subtle hue of which may be selected by the caster.
It cannot be cast on a single target or object,
but rather on an area. The effect is permanent (unless
<i>dispelled</i>), so long as the caster remains within
10 miles; otherwise, the dweomer begins to dissipate
in subtle degrees, ending in a number of months equal
to the sorcererâ€™s CA. <i>Continuous light</i> can counter
<i>continuous darkness</i> and <i>darkness</i>.</p>"
