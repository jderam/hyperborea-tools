Desc: "<p>Freezes metallic objects to blistering temperatures.
For every CA level of the sorcerer, as much as five
square feet of metal can be affected, equivalent to one
Small creature per CA level, or one Medium creature
per 2 CA levels; e.g., a CA 6 sorcerer can affect three
adjacent armoured humans. For larger creatures, the
referee must determine a reasonable number of potential
targets using the above guidelines (e.g., a mailclad
giant may be considered the equivalent of four
fighters). <i>Cool metal</i> is quick to cool, freeze, and then
blister; likewise, it is quick to warm. The dweomer
persists for 9 rounds, with metal treated thusly if in
contact with skin:</p>
<ul><li>Round 1: Metal becomes <i>cold</i>,
uncomfortable to the touch</li>
<li>Rounds 2–4: Metal <i>freezes</i>,
biting for 1d4 hp damage per round</li>
<li>Round 5: Metal <i>blisters</i> for 2d4 hp damage</li>
<li>Rounds 6–8: Metal warms to <i>freezing</i>,
biting for 1d4 hp damage per round</li>
<li>Round 9: Metal warms to <i>cold</i></li></ul>
<p>Metal affected by <i>blistering cold</i> (round 5 of the spell)
is subject to brittleness. If affected normal (nonmagical)
armour is struck, it may shatter. The same applies
to a normal sword, axe blade, etc. <i>Cold protection</i> and
<i>cold resistance</i> negate the harmful effects of this spell.</p>"
