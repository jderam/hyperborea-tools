Desc: "<p>The sorcerer casts this spell upon the femur of a
human, humanoid, or Medium animal to create a
<b>+1 war club</b> (1d6+1 hp damage, or 1d8+1 hp if wielded
two-handed), whether or not the sorcerer is skilled
with such a weapon; i.e., no unskilled weapon attack
penalty applies. The club is more effective versus undead,
functioning as a <b>+2 war club</b> (1d6+2 or 1d8+2 hp
damage). The sorcerer cannot attack with the <i>cudgel of
bone</i> on the same round the spell is cast; neither can it
be used by another individual. Upon the spellâ€™s termination,
the <i>cudgel of bone</i> reverts to a normal thighbone.</p>"
