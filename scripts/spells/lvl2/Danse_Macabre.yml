Desc: "<p>The corpse of a human or humanoid is animated to
undeath and thenceforth controlled like a marionette
by the sorcerer’s waving fingers. The corpse can be
directed to move, pick up objects, or even attack. The
creature functions as a <b>skeleton</b> or <b>zombie</b>, depending
on the stats of the corpse, though the latter lacks
the <i>zombiism</i> disease. This spell requires the constant
chanting and gesticulating of the caster. Once the caster
ceases to direct, or when the spell’s duration elapses,
the corpse will crumple to the ground.</p>"
