Desc: "<p>Suspends the deleterious effects of any toxin to which
the subject has been exposed. This spell does not eliminate
poison effects as <i>neutralize poison</i> does; as its title
suggests, it but <i>delays poison</i>. Poisons that have an
immediate impact cannot be <i>delayed</i>; however, poisons
that have continuous or secondary effects are <i>delayed</i>.
And if a poison has a delayed onset, it too is further
<i>delayed</i>. Once the spell has ended, the poison’s effects
resume as normal.</p>
<p>Note that if the poison affliction is the result of a venomous
bite or sting, this spell can be used in conjunction
with <i>draw poison</i> ability of barbarians and shamans.
With the poison magically suspended in the victim’s
system, a barbarian or shaman can <i>draw poison</i> on a
5-in-6 chance of success for the duration of the spell.</p>
<p>Lastly, <i>delay poison</i> may also revive one who has expired
from poison, so long as the spell is cast within
12 rounds (2 minutes) of death and a successful <i>trauma
survival</i> check is made (see <b>Chapter 3: Statistics</b>,
<i>constitution</i>). The deceased poison victim is restored to
0 hp, albeit at a permanent loss of 1 constitution point.</p>"
