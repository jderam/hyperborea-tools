Desc: "<p>The sorcerer perceives the presence of warm-blooded
creatures within 60 feet, including their sizes and number.
The sorcerer must stand stationary and concentrate;
movement disrupts the spell. <i>Detect body heat</i>
is obstructed by metal of one-inch thickness, stone of
six-inch thickness, or wood of one-foot thickness; lead
completely foils the spell. Undead are not detected by
this spell, and cold-blooded creatures are detected only
if they have recently warmed themselves in the sun or
otherwise. Detection of other monster types is at the
discretion of the referee, who must decide whether
they are warm-blooded.</p>"
