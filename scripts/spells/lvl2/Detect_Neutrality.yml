Desc: "<p>Allows the sorcerer to sense whether an observed
person, place, or thing is balanced with Neutrality of
alignment, tainted neither with Good nor Evil, Law nor
Chaos. If the subject of this observation is anything
but Neutral, the caster will perceive the imbalance.
The caster cannot discern the exact alignment of any
non-Neutral person, place, or thing, but merely that
the absence of Neutrality is present.</p>"
