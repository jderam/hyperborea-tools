Desc: "<p>Allows the sorcerer to determine the exact alignment
of the selected individual(s). One round is required for
each person scanned, so six creatures can be scrutinized
if all are within range. The caster must remain
stationary, staring at each subject. No saving throw
is allowed for this spell, and if the sorcerer exercises
discretion, the spellâ€™s casting might go unnoticed.</p>"
