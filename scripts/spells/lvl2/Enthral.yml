Desc: "<p>The sorcerer orates, preaches, or sermonizes; hence,
the listeners must comprehend the language of the
speaker and listen for at least two minutes. Then, with
clever imperceptibility, the spell is laid. The caster may
<i>enthral</i> an audience whose members have 4 HD or fewer
unless they make <i>sorcery</i> saving throws, modified
by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable. If the audience
is not of the caster’s species (humanoids or giants, for
example), or if they are otherwise unfriendly towards
the caster’s particular background, the saving throw
is made at a +1 to +4 bonus (as judged by the referee).
For a large audience, similar HD listeners may be
grouped together. <i>Enthralled</i> creatures will continue
to listen to the expounding sorcerer, viewing the orator
as having 18 charisma. Those who make the save
may have an unfavorable reaction, seeing the orator as
boring, offensive, foolish, and/or disgusting. Once the
sorcerer ceases evangelizing, the spell will terminate,
but effects remain for 1 turn.</p>"
