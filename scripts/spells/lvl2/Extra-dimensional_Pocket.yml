Desc: "<p>This dweomer is placed on the pocket of a cloak, coat,
robe, shirt, tunic, vest, or like garment. The pocket can
have a mouth no greater than six inches wide. Such a
pocket, which may normally bear about 5 pounds, can
instead bear 100 pounds via an extra-dimensional space,
and at CA 7, 200 pounds may be borne. Too, the wearer
does not feel the weight of the magical pocket’s contents.</p>
<p>Note that the <i>extra-dimensional pocket’s</i> mouth remains
unchanged, so only coins or other small items
can fit inside. If the pocket is torn, ripped, burnt, or
otherwise damaged, the contents will be ejected into
another dimension. If the spell’s duration ends and the
pocket holds more items than the garment could normally
contain, the items will eject from the garment in
a five-foot fountain of coins, gems, and whatnot. However,
if cast once per day, on or just before the same
hour, the effects of this spell can be endlessly enjoyed.</p>"
