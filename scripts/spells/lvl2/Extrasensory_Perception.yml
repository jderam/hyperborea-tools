Desc: "<p>Allows the caster, who must pinch a copper coin betwixt
thumb and forefinger, to detect the vague surface
thoughts (not precise words) of any creature within
the spellâ€™s range, so long as the creature has thoughts.
(Most undead and constructs, for example, do not.)
<i>Extrasensory perception</i> targets a single creature;
once selected, another cannot be targeted. No saving
throw is allowed unless the target is of 6 HD or greater.
If so, a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable, must be made. When reading
the surface thoughts of a lower-order creature,
only its most basic instincts will be revealed. The spell
also can be used to determine if a monster lurks behind
a door or down a dark tunnel (so long as the monster
is within range). The spell can penetrate one inch of
metal, six inches of stone, or one foot of wood; however,
the thinnest sheet of lead will obstruct it.</p>"
