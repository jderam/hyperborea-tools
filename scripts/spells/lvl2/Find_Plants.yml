Desc: "<p>Allows the sorcerer to locate any sought-after plant or
plant type, providing it is available. Specific plants with
which the caster is familiar may be sought, including
roots, fruits and berries, and fungi. Only one species or
type can be selected when the spell is cast. The radius
of detection is 240 feet from the caster, who may move
as normal (though not run) throughout the duration of
the spell. Full concentration is not necessary, but the
effect is lost if another spell or ability is used.</p>"
