Desc: "<p>This dweomer is placed on any article that can be
closed (e.g., book, bottle, box, chest, door, shutter). If
the object is opened, a blast of fire explodes in a fivefoot
radius per CA level, causing 1d4 hp damage per
CA level to any creature within the blast radius. A <i>sorcery</i>
saving throw can be made for half damage. The
<i>fire trapped</i> item is never affected by the spell; neither
is the original caster. A sorcerer may maintain as many
undischarged <i>fire traps</i> as he or she has CA levels.</p>
<p>Note that a <i>knock</i> spell can open a <i>fire trapped</i> portal,
yet the spell is not triggered until a person manually
opens it. <i>Fire trap</i> can be discovered and removed via
a thief â€™s <i>manipulate traps</i> ability, though failure to
disarm the trap automatically detonates it. It can also
be removed by a <i>dispel magic</i> spell.</p>"
