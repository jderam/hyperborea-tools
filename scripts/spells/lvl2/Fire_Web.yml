Desc: "<p>From the sorcerer’s fingertips shoots a flaming web
that ensnares and burns one Medium or smaller
creature for 3d4 hp damage. The victim is allowed an
<i>avoidance</i> saving throw. If the save is successful, the
victim suffers half damage and is not ensnared; i.e., the
target is merely grazed, and the <i>fire web</i> collapses into
a small ball for the duration of the spell. If the save
fails, the target is trapped in the burning web for the
spell’s duration (i.e., <i>prone</i>), and subsequent damage is
sustained: 2d4 hp on round 2, and 1d4 hp on round 3.
Furthermore, any flammable clothing or gear is likely
destroyed (cloaks smoulder, cloth sacks burn and spill
their contents, and so forth). The <i>dispel magic</i> spell
extinguishes this dweomer.</p>"
