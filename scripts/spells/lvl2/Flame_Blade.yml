Desc: "<p>The sorcerer must grip a bladeless hilt (of any sword
or dagger) to cast this spell. Upon reciting a sibilant incantation,
a <i>flame blade</i> in the shape of a long scimitar
springs from the bladeless hilt. The <i>flame blade</i> may
be wielded as though it were a magical scimitar, whether
or not the sorcerer is skilled with such a weapon;
i.e., no unskilled weapon attack penalty applies.</p>
<p>The <i>flame blade</i> functions at +2 “to hit” and inflicts
1d8+2 hp damage (1d10+2 hp if held in two hands),
with an additional +2 damage bonus versus undead
(1d8+4 or 1d10+4 hp total). Fire-resistant creatures,
however, are afforded their standard resistance (usually
half damage). <i>Flame blade</i> also can be used to
ignite oil and other combustibles (e.g., cloth, paper,
parchment, wood).</p>"
