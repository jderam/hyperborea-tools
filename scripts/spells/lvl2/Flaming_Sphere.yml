Desc: "<p>A burning globe of six-foot diameter is evoked by the
caster. This <i>flaming sphere</i> begins rotating at a rate of
10 MV in the direction the caster points, rolling over
barriers and other obstructions up to five feet high.
Combustibles are set ablaze by the <i>flaming sphere</i>,
and struck creatures suffer 2d4 hp damage unless
sorcery saving throws are successful. As long as the
caster concentrates and points, the <i>flaming sphere</i> can
be directed for 1 round per CA level; otherwise, it remains
stationary until the duration elapses.</p>"
