Desc: "<p>A thick mass of green-hued, foul-smelling vapour is
evoked by the caster, the cloud being 40 × 20 × 20 feet
in volume. The <i>fog cloud</i> travels away from the caster
at a rate of 10 MV until the spell’s duration ends, moving
in a direction pointed by the caster; or it can be
left to remain stationary. Once the sorcerer points, the
<i>cloud’s</i> momentum cannot be altered unless significant
wind exists, which always prevails over the will of the
sorcerer. Those who are consumed by the <i>fog cloud</i> can
see no farther than five feet, and the range of <i>infrared
vision</i> is halved.</p>"
