Desc: "<p>Temporarily transforms baser coins to gold, affecting
100 coins per CA level. Laying this dweomer requires
one gold coin per 100 coins to be altered. The component
coin must be ground to dust and sprinkled over
the coins to be transmuted. To the unwary, the coins
have the look, feel, and weight of gold; to the canny,
they may be identified as counterfeits. <i>Sorcery</i> saving
throws may be made by those who handle the <i>foolâ€™s
gold</i>. The saving throws are modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>,
if applicable; magicians, thieves, and some
professionals (e.g., jewellers, shrewd merchants or
barkeeps) gain +3 save bonuses.</p>"
