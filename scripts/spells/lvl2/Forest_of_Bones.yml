Desc: "<p>Skeletal hands and claws emerge from the earth, grabbing
and clutching at all within this spell’s 40-foot-diameter
area of effect. Those that fail <i>avoidance</i> saving
throws are held
fast for the duration
of the spell.
Those that succeed
can negotiate
through at
half their normal
movement rates.
Any creature
that subsequently
enters the
enchanted area
during the spell’s
duration is likewise
subject to
its effects. Giant
humanoids, monsters,
or robust
animals save
at +4, or they
might be unaffected
by this
spell, as judged
by the referee.
Confined victims can attempt an <i>extraordinary feat of
strength</i> to break free. Confined spell casters may be
required to make an <i>extraordinary feat of dexterity</i> in
order to cast a spell. Note that <i>turn undead</i> does not
affect the <i>forest of bones</i>.</p>"
