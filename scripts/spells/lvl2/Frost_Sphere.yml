Desc: "<p>A swirling frost globe of six-foot diameter is evoked
by the caster. This sphere begins rotating at a rate of
10 MV in the direction the caster points, rolling over
barriers and other obstructions up to five feet high. Water
is frozen by the <i>frost sphere</i>, small fires are snuffed,
and struck creatures suffer 2d4 hp damage unless <i>sorcery</i>
saving throws are successful, which end the spell.
As long as the caster concentrates and points, the <i>frost
sphere</i> can be directed for 1 round per CA level; otherwise,
it remains stationary until the duration elapses.</p>"
