Desc: "<p>The sorcererâ€™s touch becomes like that of a <b>ghoul</b>. The
first person touched must make a <i>death</i> saving throw
or become locked in rigid paralysis. The reverse of this
spell, <i>reverse ghoul touch</i>, removes such paralysis, as
well as that caused by actual ghouls; it is ineffective
versus paralysis from other sources, such as the <i>hold
person</i> spell.</p>"
