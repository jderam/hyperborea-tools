Desc: "<p>The sorcerer must have 25 gp of gold dust to cast this
spell, which may be in the form of gold ground with a
file or stone. The sorcerer effects a 20-foot cube of <i>glitterdust</i>
that explodes within the spell’s range, covering
its victims from head to toe in sparkling gold dust. The
cloud itself is no more than a flash, so this spell’s duration
is not for the cloud, but rather its sorcerous effect.</p>
<p>Those within the cloud must make <i>sorcery</i> saving
throws or be blinded for the spell’s duration. Blind
creatures always lose initiative and suffer −4 penalties
on attack rolls, armour class, and saving throws. This
spell also reveals invisible creatures, as the <i>glitterdust</i>
clings to and sparkles on them for its duration.</p>"
