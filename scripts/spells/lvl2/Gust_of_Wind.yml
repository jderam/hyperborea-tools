Desc: "<p>A breeze blows from the caster (in the direction the
sorcerer faces) in a 10-foot-wide path that is 5 feet long
per CA level; e.g., a CA 6 sorcerer can evoke a <i>gust of
wind</i> that is 10 feet wide and 30 feet long. <i>Gust of wind</i>
extinguishes small fires, though it fans and excites the
flames of larger blazes; too, it disperses and thus dispels
magical clouds, fogs, and smoke, such as <i>cloudkill</i>,
<i>fog cloud</i>, and <i>stinking cloud</i>. At its greatest effectiveness,
this spell can belly the sail of a small craft.</p>"
