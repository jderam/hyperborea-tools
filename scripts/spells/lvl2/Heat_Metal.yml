Desc: "<p>Heats metallic objects to searing temperatures. For
every CA level of the sorcerer, five square feet of metal
can be affected, equivalent to one Small creature per
CA level, or one Medium creature per 2 CA levels; e.g.,
a CA 6 sorcerer can affect three adjacent armoured
people. For larger creatures, the referee must determine
a reasonable number of potential targets using
the above guidelines (e.g., a <b>mountain ape</b> may be
considered the equivalent of two people). <i>Heat metal</i>
is quick to warm, burn, and then sear; likewise, it is
quick to cool. The dweomer persists for 9 rounds, with
metal treated thusly if in contact with skin:</p>
<ul><li><b>Round 1:</b> Metal becomes <i>hot</i>, uncomfortable to
the touch</li>
<li><b>Rounds 2–4:</b> Metal becomes <i>extremely hot</i>,
burning for 1d4 hp damage per round</li>
<li><b>Round 5:</b> Metal <i>sears</i> for 2d4 hp damage</li>
<li><b>Rounds 6–8:</b> Metal cools to <i>extremely hot</i>,
burning for 1d4 hp damage per round</li>
<li><b>Round 9:</b> Metal cools to <i>hot</i></li></ul>
<p>Materials such as cloth, leather, or wood in touch with
<i>searing</i> metal are subject to smouldering or even combusting,
as per the referee’s judgment. <i>Fire protection</i>
and <i>fire resistance</i> negate the harmful effects of this
spell.</p>"
