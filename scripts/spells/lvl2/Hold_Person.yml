Desc: "<p><i>Hold person</i> victims are frozen still, motionless, paralyzed.
This enchantment affects humans, humanoids,
and giants. It can be cast at a single opponent
or a group of individuals, so long as they are within a
10-foot radius of the spell’s primary target.</p>
<p>When cast at a group, as many as four individuals may
be affected, beginning with those closest to the primary
target. Each target is allowed a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw
to resist the spell; if but a single target is selected, its
saving throw is made at a −2 penalty. Any targets of
9 HD or greater gain a +4 saving throw bonus. Saving
throws are modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if
applicable.</p>"
