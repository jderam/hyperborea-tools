Desc: "<p>With precise gestures the sorcerer creates waves of
polychromatic, zigzagging lines that fill the air in a
30-foot-diameter circle. The spell affects no more than
24 HD of creatures, each of which is entitled to a <i>sorcery</i>
saving throw, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>,
if applicable. <i>Hypnotic pattern</i> affects those of the
lowest HD first, though not blind or unseeing creatures.
The ensorcelled become mesmerized imbeciles,
staring at the colours until the spell terminates. The
spell persists as long as the caster continues to gesticulate,
plus 1d4 rounds thereafter.</p>"
