Desc: "<p>A suit of frozen laminated armour clads the sorcerer.
<i>Ice armour</i> is formed of dense blue ice that is cold to
the touch for all but the caster. It provides AC 5 and
DR 1. <i>Ice armour</i> is so perfectly articulated and lightweight
that it does not impinge the sorcererâ€™s spell
casting in any way, though the standard 30 MV applies.
<i>Ice armour</i> is vaporized by magical fire (neutralizing a
single magical fire attack), but normal fire has minimal
impact. When the spell ends, <i>ice armour</i> crumbles to a
thousand shards of ice.</p>"
