Desc: "<p>The sorcerer must grip a 1½-foot haft of wood to cast
this dweomer. Upon incanting the spell, an axe blade
composed of steely-blue ice forms at the end of the
haft. The <i>ice axe</i> can be wielded as though it were a
magical hand axe; it functions at a +2 “to hit” and delivers
1d6+2 hp damage. If hurled (90-foot range), the
<i>ice axe</i> automatically strikes its target for 1d6+4 hp
damage, but this attack ends the spell.</p>"
