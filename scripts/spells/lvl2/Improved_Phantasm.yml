Desc: "<p>A visual illusion is created, a projected image of nearly
anything the caster can imagine, as large as 30 × 30 ×
30 feet in area. Victims must be living creatures of animal
intelligence or greater; undead, constructs, oozes,
and the like are unaffected. <i>Improved phantasm</i> can be
used to create an attacking monster or another damaging
hazard, but the illusion is strictly of sight and sound,
not of smell or temperature. The auditory component
of an <i>improved phantasm</i> cannot consist of precisely
spoken words, but the semblance of garbled speech,
mumbling, shouting, and so forth are possible. These
sounds can create the opportunity for more believable
illusions than those generated by the <i>phantasm</i> spell.</p>
<p>Once cast, this spell persists as long as the caster concentrates
and for 2 rounds thereafter, unless the illusion
is struck for 1 hp of damage or more, or unless it is
terminated via a <i>dispel phantasm</i> spell. An <i>improved
phantasmal</i> monster is AC 8 and will disappear if hit;
otherwise, it can continue to attack as manipulated by
the caster. The caster can direct the illusion to move
anywhere within the spell’s range; such manoeuvres
require his full attention, though he can walk at half
speed and maintain control.</p>
<p><i>Improved phantasm</i> targets are not allowed saving
throws unless the referee feels the illusion is unbelievable
to its viewers, in which case <i>sorcery</i> saving throws
should be rolled, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if
applicable. Credibility may come into question because
of the illusion’s lack of scent or thermal properties. To
the eyes of the disbeliever, the <i>improved phantasm</i>
will become a flawed and flickering transparent image.
An intelligent disbeliever may then alert allies, whose
saves are made at a bonus of +4. Otherwise, this illusion
can inflict real physical damage: 1d4 hp per CA
level per round to each victim. Such damage remains
even if the spell is subsequently broken.</p>"
