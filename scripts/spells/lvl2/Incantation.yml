Desc: "<p>The sorcerer chants eldritch invocations that effect a
potent benison to allies—and a malison to enemies—within
a 25-foot radius. Allies gain +1 “to hit” and +1
to saving throws; enemies are penalized −1 “to hit”
and −1 saving throws. The bonuses/penalties persist
as long as the caster continues to chant and remains
perfectly stationary (no dexterity bonuses applicable).
<i>Dispel magic</i> or <i>silence</i> can break this spell.</p>"
