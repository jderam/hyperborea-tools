Desc: "<p>The sorcerer’s tongue becomes long, forked, and black.
The sorcerer then speaks in the language of netherworldly
dæmons. Such <i>infernal tongues</i> are known to
raise the hackles of ordinary animals of 3 HD or fewer,
causing them to flee the presence of the sorcerer if
they fail <i>sorcery</i> saving throws. Any number of animals
can be affected, but they must be within 30 feet
of the sorcerer. Animals that make their saving throws
have a 2-in-6 chance of becoming enraged and attacking
the caster at a +2 bonus. Of course, humans may
be quite frightened as well; hence, the referee might
impose <i>morale</i> (ML) checks for common folk, and even
classed individuals, in certain situations.</p>"
