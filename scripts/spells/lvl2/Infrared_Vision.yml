Desc: "<p>The caster or other recipient can perceive light in the
infrared spectrum, effectively seeing in the dark to a
range of 60 feet. All subtle differences of heat radiation
are defined before the eyes of the recipient so that a
warm-blooded creature stands out against the cool walls
of a dungeon chamber. Fire or other notable heat in the
proximity of the viewer can be a hindrance (e.g., lantern,
torch) or a complete obstruction (e.g., bonfire, lava).
This spell does not reveal invisible objects or creatures.</p>"
