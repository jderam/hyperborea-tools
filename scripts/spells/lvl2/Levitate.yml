Desc: "<p>The caster or other recipient floats up or down in the
air at a rate of 10 MV. Maximum <i>levitation</i> weight is
300 pounds. Horizontal movement is impossible unless
some surface such as a ceiling is reached, in which
case the <i>levitated</i> person can use his hands and feet
to travel at 10 MV. One can cast spells whilst floating,
but combat (melee and missiles) is more difficult, the
<i>levitate</i> recipient suffering −2 “to hit” on attack rolls
and losing any DX bonus to AC.</p>
<p>If this spell is cast on another person, the sorcerer
must concentrate on directing the target, <i>levitating</i>
him a maximum distance of 20 feet per CA level. If
<i>levitate</i> is cast on an unwilling subject, it is allowed
a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw to resist the effect, and if its
HD is greater than the sorcerer’s, the saving throw is
rolled with a +4 bonus. The spell can be cancelled at a
time of the caster’s choosing.</p>"
