Desc: "<p>The caster announces an object to be found; it might be
a lost sword, a bronze door, or the like. The object must
be well known by the caster: its colour, texture, size,
and so forth. Someone describing the item to the caster
is insufficient, though a detailed picture may suffice.
If the object is within range, the caster will know which
direction to seek, but not the precise distance.</p>"
