Desc: "<p>Once activated, this enchantment causes a two-footwide
illusory mouth to manifest. The <i>magic mouth</i>
appears where the caster places the spell. It might be
triggered by movement within 10 feet of it, or by other
conditions as the caster prescribes, though the trigger
range can be no greater than 10 feet. (For instance,
placed upon a door, the <i>magic mouth</i> might only appear
if the door is rapped on.)</p>
<p>Once triggered, the <i>magic mouth</i> speaks a message
that may not exceed 25 words. It might speak in a sibilant
tongue, a commanding tone, a kind voice, or any
like variation, though only in a language known by the
caster. <i>Dispel magic</i> terminates this enchantment.</p>"
