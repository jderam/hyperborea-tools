Desc: "<p>Causes victims to forget the last minute of their lives
prior to and including the casting of this spell. The targets
may make <i>sorcery</i> saving throws, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. One to four persons,
chosen by the caster, can be affected, but the greater the
number of targets, the less potent the spell: Two targets
each receive a +1 bonus to their saving throws, three
targets each receive a +2 bonus, and four targets each
receive a +3 bonus. This spell will not negate the effects
of other enchantments such as <i>charm person</i> or <i>geas</i>.
Lost memories can be restored via a <i>heal</i> spell.</p>"
