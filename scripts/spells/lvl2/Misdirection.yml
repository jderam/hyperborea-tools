Desc: "<p>Counteracts detection spells, including <i>detect magic</i>,
<i>detect snares and pits</i>, <i>detect illusion</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i>,
<i>distinguish alignment</i>, and other like sorceries
in a 25-foot-diameter area. However, this spell cannot
prevent the clericâ€™s version of <i>true seeing</i> from revealing
the truth. This spell creates an opposite reading
for detection sorcery users (spells, items, supernatural
abilities). For example, a magic statue can appear
mundane to a detect magic caster, but perhaps a nearby
mundane rope appears to have a magical aura.</p>"
