Desc: "<p>This ritual requires 12 turns (2 hours) to complete. By
handling a fresh corpse and speaking baleful incantations,
the sorcerer infuses the corpse with enchanted
preservative spices (requires 10 gp in herbs). Then
the caster evokes violet-charged cloth wraps to take
form. The enchanted wraps spin and weave about the
corpse, covering and preserving it from decomposition.
If the caster later attempts to animate the corpse to a
<b>zombie</b>, <b>flesh automaton</b>, or similar form, it will gain
+2 hp per HD. This spell can also preserve a fallen comrade
from decomposition, should allies seek to convey
the fallen elsewhere for interment or sorcerous revival.</p>"
