Desc: "<p>Swirling, misty vapours surround the caster in a cubic
area with sides up to 10 feet per CA level, as chosen
by the caster; e.g., a CA 6 sorcerer <i>obscures</i> up to a
60 × 60 × 60-foot area. Within the <i>obscured</i> area, visibility
is reduced to five feet, and spells such as <i>infrared
vision</i> are ineffective. A strong wind reduces the
duration of <i>obscure</i> by 90%; i.e., the 10-minute (1-turn)
duration will be reduced to 1 minute (6 rounds).</p>"
