Desc: "<p>Undisturbed the sorcerer must meditate for five minutes
before casting this spell from a nigh-trancelike
state. During this preparatory phase, the caster “tunes
out” the sound of his or her own heartbeat (and those
of any allies). Once the spell is cast, the sorcerer can
hear the heartbeats of all other living creatures within
60 feet. The strength or speed of each heartbeat may
be determined; however, if many heartbeats (10+) are
heard, they become difficult to discern from one another.
This spell penetrates 10 feet of packed earth, two
feet of wood, one foot of stone, or one inch of metal, but
even the thinnest sheet of lead can mask a heartbeat.</p>"
