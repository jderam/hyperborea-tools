Desc: "<p>A quasi-real suit of dull black plate mail clads the
sorcerer. The armour is formed of shadow material
conjured from the Black Gulf; it provides AC 3 and
DR 2. <i>Phantasmal armour</i> is weightless; it does not
affect movement as normal plate mail does. Except
for shields, this spell does not combine or “stack” with
other armour. <i>Phantasmal armour</i> can be terminated
by <i>dispel phantasm</i>.</p>"
