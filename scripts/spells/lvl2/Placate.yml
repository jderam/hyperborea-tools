pending a failed <i>sorcery</i> saving throw for each
target, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.
The spell affects hostile targets in a 20-foot-radius
area of effect, save for the undead, constructs, and like
mindless creatures. The affected will cease combat,
their desire for bloodshed quelled, their anger pacified.
<i>Placated</i> creatures will not harm the sorcerer or any
allies for the duration of this spell and may present
as somewhat confused or introspective. If a <i>placated</i>
creature is attacked, the spell is broken.</p>"
