Desc: "<p>A small, torch-like flame ignites in the palm of the
sorcerer, creating a 40-foot radius of light. The flame
does not harm the caster. It remains in effect for the
spellâ€™s duration, so long as no other spells are cast. The
sorcerer can terminate the spell by closing his or her
hand to a fist.</p>
<p>The sorcerer can opt to hurl the flame within 30 feet
as a ranged attack using the <i>flask hurling</i> rules (see
<b>Chapter 9: Combat</b>, <i>combat options</i>). The flame bursts
in a five-foot diameter if it strikes, igniting combustibles
and causing 1d4 hp damage, +1 hp per CA level
(e.g., a CA 5 sorcerer can hurl a <i>produced flame</i> that
inflicts 1d4+5 hp damage). A <i>sorcery</i> saving throw reduces
damage by half.</p>"
