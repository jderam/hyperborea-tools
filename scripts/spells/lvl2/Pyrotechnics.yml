Desc: "<p>Uses an existing flame (e.g., brazier, campfire, torch)
to create a great, fiery spectacle of flashing colours and
luminous lights. Alternatively, a thick, rolling smoke can
be produced, clouding a 20-foot-diameter area around
the blaze. Once created, the <i>pyrotechnics</i> persist until
the spell duration is met or the source is extinguished.</p>"
