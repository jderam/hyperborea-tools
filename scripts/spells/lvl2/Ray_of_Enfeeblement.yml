Desc: "<p>From the hand of the caster springs a silvery flash of
light that automatically strikes its intended target,
sapping the victim of 4 strength points. A <i>sorcery</i> saving
throw negates this spell. If a monster is affected,
the referee should reduce damage dice: d20 reduced to
d12; d12 to d10; d10 to d8; d8 to d6; d6 to d4; d4 to d3;
d3 to d2; d2 to 1. Bonuses to damage dice should also
be proportionately reduced, so a creature that normally
inflicts 1d8+2 hp damage should inflict 1d6+1 hp
damage, and so on.</p>"
