Desc: "<p>The sorcerer casts skyward a rope of 5- to 25-foot
length. The rope stands rigid and upright; it then may
be climbed. At the apex, the caster and as many as
five allies can enter and hide in a small extra-dimensional
space. This pocket dimension is a grey, opaque,
featureless cube of 20 × 20 × 20 feet, illumed dimly
within, the air breathable. The rope remains hanging;
if pulled, the hiders will fall out, spilling to the ground.
Similarly, if the spell expires, those within the extra-dimensional
space precipitate to the ground.</p>"
