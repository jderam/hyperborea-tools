Desc: "<p>Summons a scythe, surrounded by black motes of
negative energy, to materialize in the air. The floating
weapon can be directed to attack any opponent within
the spell’s range. The <i>scythe of the reaper</i> strikes with a
<i>fighting ability</i> (FA) equal to that of the caster, for a base
1d8 hp damage. For necromancers only, the weapon is
+1 “to hit” and damage for every 3 CA levels:</p>
<ul><li>CA 1–3 = +1</li>
<li>CA 4–6 = +2</li>
<li>CA 7–9 = +3</li>
<li>CA 10–12 = +4</li></ul>
<p>For other casters, the bonus damage for every three
CA levels applies, but not the “to hit” bonus. Hence, a
CA 5 necromancer can summon a <i>scythe of the reaper</i>
that strikes at +2 “to hit” and inflicts 1d8+2 hp damage.
The caster can cast spells and take other actions
whilst continuing to direct the <i>scythe</i> at will. <i>Dispel
magic</i> terminates this spell.</p>"
