Desc: "<p>Evokes a field of absolute soundlessness that radiates
15 feet from a selected point. Creatures may move from
the spellâ€™s area of effect, but within the <i>silenced</i> field,
all noise and speech are snuffed, and spells cannot be
cast. If targeted directly at an opponent, the subject
is allowed a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw to negate the spell;
otherwise, the subject suffers utter <i>silence</i>. Spell casters
gain +1 bonuses to their saving throws for every
2 CA levels they possess.</p>"
