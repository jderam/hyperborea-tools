Desc: "<p>Allows the sorcerer to converse with a dead human,
quasi-man, humanoid, or giant, providing they speak
(or spoke, as it were) the same language. The spell can
be cast on an incomplete corpse or skeleton, so long
as at least the skull remains. The sorcerer may ask as
many as three direct questions (i.e., neither ambiguous
nor multipart questions). The deceased will then answer,
rasping its reply in a fashion and degree of truthfulness
as best determined by the referee. This spell
cannot be cast on the same subject more than once;
neither does it function on the undead.</p>"
