Desc: "<p>A translucent, sickly yellow hand surges forth, its
shape like that of the caster’s. This spell is used in
conjunction with a single subsequent touch spell, delivering
the touch spell as a ranged attack at +2 “to hit.”
This spell can be cast in advance of a combat situation;
the hand will hover before the caster until it successfully
delivers a touch spell, or the spell’s duration is
met. The <i>spectral hand</i> is incorporeal and cannot be
damaged unless the attacker utilizes a spell or magical
weapon; if attacked thusly, it may be considered AC 7
with 4 hp. It can also be broken by <i>dispel magic</i>.</p>"
