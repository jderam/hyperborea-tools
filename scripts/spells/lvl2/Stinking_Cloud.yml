Desc: "<p>Evokes a swirl of nauseous vapours in a 20 × 20 × 20-
foot area. Any breathing creatures caught in the <i>stinking
cloud</i> must make <i>death</i> (poison) saving throws or
suffer nauseating effects: coughing, gasping, and choking
for 1d6 rounds, with their ears, eyes, and throat
burning; effectively, they are <i>stunned</i>. Those who
make their saving throws are temporarily resistant to
the deleterious effects of the <i>stinking cloud</i> but must
exit it within 1 round or save again. At minimum (i.e.,
with a successful saving throw), the <i>stinking cloud</i> is
an uncomfortable irritation.</p>"
