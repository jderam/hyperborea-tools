Desc: "<p>Enhances the brawn of a human. A fighter’s strength
score is increased by 2d4 points, a cleric’s or thief ’s by
1d6, and a magician’s by 1d4, all to a maximum of 18.
(A classless “commoner” may gain 1d4 points.) If this
spell is cast on one whose strength score is already 18,
that one will gain an additional +1 “to hit,” and <i>extraordinary
feats of strength</i> will be improved by +8%.</p>"
