Desc: "<p>Sorcery transports one or more <b>lesser dæmons</b> from
Underborea as selected by the sorcerer, depending on
need. The dæmons will arrive 1 round after the spell is
cast and will perform their designated task, after which,
dead or alive, they will either disappear or turn on the
caster and/or any allies (see below). When casting this
spell, the sorcerer must explicitly state the <i>summoned</i>
type: “defender,” “illuminator,” or “seeker.”</p>
<ul><li><b>Defender</b>: <i>Summons</i> a random dæmon or
dæmons to assault the sorcerer’s enemies as directed
for no longer than 6 rounds. The target(s)
must be pointed out straight away, or else the
dæmon will attack the sorcerer and/or any allies.
If the stated target(s) is defeated, the standard
chance of betrayal applies.
<p><table><caption><b>Table 113: Summon Dæmon I Spell</b></caption>
<tr><th>d6 Result</th> <th>Defender(s) Summoned</th></tr>
<tr><td>1–3</td> <td>Dæmon, Lesser, Class i (1d2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4–5</td> <td>Dæmon, Lesser, Class ii (1d2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td> <td>Dæmon, Lesser, Class iii (1)</td></tr></table></p></li>
<li><b>Illuminator</b>: <i>Summons</i> a single <b>class iv lesser
dæmon</b>. When the <i>illuminator</i> type is designated,
the corpse or bones of a dead human or
humanoid must be present and obvious, or else
the dæmon will attack the sorcerer and/or any
allies. The questioning of the dead will then commence,
with as many as three questions asked,
as explained by the sorcerer to the dæmon. Once
this process is complete, the standard chance of
betrayal applies.</li>
<li><b>Seeker</b>: <i>Summons</i> a single <b>class v lesser dæmon</b>
to search and destroy. When the <i>seeker</i> type is
designated, the sorcerer also must describe the
prey (name, species, and so forth). The dæmon
then will track its quarry until it is found and
killed, after which the standard chance of betrayal
applies. If no trail is found within 6 rounds, the
dæmon will attack the sorcerer and/or any allies.
If called upon to face an enemy that it cannot
hunt, it will turn on the sorcerer.</li></ul>
<p><i>Betrayal:</i> Dæmons are infamous for betrayal. Upon
completing their prescribed task, they may turn on the
sorcerer and/or any allies on a 1-in-6 chance. Dæmons
are, however, subject to morale checks during the
entire <i>summon dæmon</i> process. Those that fail will
attempt to flee (if possible), now permanent inhabitants
of Hyperborea that may one day seek revenge.
Wise sorcerers are known to take sanctuary within the
confines of a candlelit magic circle whilst casting and
maintaining this spell; of course, the magic circle will
only protect the sorcerer, not allies.</p>"
