Desc: "<p>The caster’s eyes emit ultraviolet radiation in a 60-footlong
cone that is 30 feet wide at its terminus. For the
spell’s duration, the sorcerer can perceive the ultraviolet
spectrum in varying shades of blue, violet, and white;
effectively, the caster sees in the dark. This spell does
not allow one to detect invisible objects or creatures.</p>"
