Desc: "<p>The target of this spell (must be intelligent; see note
below) perceives everything seen and heard as hilarious
unless they make a successful <i>sorcery</i> saving throw,
modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable. If the
save fails, the victim will begin to chuckle and giggle. On
the next round they will collapse to the ground, howling
and shrieking with <i>ungovernable hideous laughter</i>
(effectively <i>prone</i>). This condition persists for 3 rounds
(again, the first round was chuckling and giggling). Even
after the spell ends, the victim of this enchantment must
spend 1 round recovering (no attacks allowed, though no
longer considered <i>prone</i>). This spell functions solely on
creatures with a sense of humour (humans, humanoids,
giants, intelligent monsters, and so forth); it does not
work on animals or otherwise unintelligent creatures.</p>"
