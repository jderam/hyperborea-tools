Desc: "<p>By handling the corpse, carcass, or skeletal remains
of an expired creature, the sorcerer enters a trance
and visualizes the last 10 minutes (1 turn) of the deceased’s
life, as seen through their eyes. Naturally, this
revelation requires a full 10 minutes, for not a moment
is missed. At the spell’s conclusion, the sorcerer will
emerge from the trance exhausted and emotionally
troubled/withdrawn for 1d6 turns.</p>"
