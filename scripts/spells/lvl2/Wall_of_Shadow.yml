Desc: "<p>The sorcerer conjures from the Black Gulf a barrier
of darkness. The <i>wall of shadow</i> must be 10 feet thick
and 10 feet high; only the length is malleable, allow for
10 feet per CA level (e.g., a CA 7 sorcerer may create a
10 × 10-foot wall that is 70 feet long). The <i>wall</i> can be
straight or form a semicircle.</p>
<p>The <i>wall of shadow</i> is not impenetrable; persons and
objects can be seen through it, but they are vague, hazy,
and nebulous. Missile fire directed at a person beyond
the wall is at a −2 penalty. Other benefits might be
derived from this spell; e.g., a thief attempting to <i>hide</i>
might gain a bonus to his chance-in-twelve, or perhaps
even automatic success, at the referee’s discretion.</p>"
