Desc: "<p>Thick, sticky strands of webbing stream from the
caster’s fingertips, covering a target area no greater
than 10 × 10 × 20 feet. Targets are allowed <i>avoidance</i>
saving throws to evade contact with the <i>web</i>. Those
who make the save can carefully make their way out,
moving at half speed. Those who failed the save can
attempt to break free one round later:
<ul><li><b>ST 3–8</b> = trapped until spell expires</li>
<li><b>ST 9–12</b> = 2d6 rounds to break free</li>
<li><b>ST 13–18</b> = 1d6 rounds to break free</li></ul>
A <b>flame tongue</b> sword wielder can slash through in
but 1 round. If the webs are set ablaze with a torch
or other fire source, they will catch quickly, the entire
mass burning in 2 rounds. Those trapped within the
conflagration suffer 1d6 hp damage per round (1d8 hp
vs. undead), and any flammable clothing or gear is subject
to burning and ruination.</p>"
