Desc: "<p>Conjures a brilliant war hammer composed of positive
energy. The floating weapon can be directed to attack
any opponent within the spell’s range. The caster need
not focus on it; other actions (e.g., fighting or casting
other spells) can be taken whilst directing the <i>weird
war hammer</i> at will. The <i>hammer</i> strikes with a <i>fighting
ability</i> (FA) equal to the sorcerer. For every 4 CA
levels, the weapon is +1 “to hit” and damage:
<ul><li><b>CA 1–4</b> = +1</li>
<li><b>CA 5–8</b> = +2</li>
<li><b>CA 9–12</b> = +3</li></ul>
Hence, a CA 5 sorcerer can conjure a <i>weird war hammer</i>
that strikes at +2 “to hit” and inflicts 1d8+2 hp
damage. <i>Dispel magic</i> terminates this spell.</p>"
