Desc: "<p>Evokes a gentle breeze to whirl around the sorcerer
and then depart, taking with it a spoken message
no more than 12 words (not including articles <i>a</i>, <i>an</i>,
and <i>the</i>). The message will be conveyed to a familiar
recipient within the spellâ€™s range, so long as no insurmountable
obstacles prevent delivery. If the caster
and the subject are both outdoors, the spell is almost
always successful; however, if one or the other is in a
dungeon or inside a building, obstructions (e.g., walls,
closed doors) can preclude the spell from functioning
as desired. When the <i>whispering wind</i> reaches its objective,
it swirls about the recipient creature and softly
murmurs its message.</p>"
