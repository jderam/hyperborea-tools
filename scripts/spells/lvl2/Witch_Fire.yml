Desc: "<p>Creates fist-sized balls of phosphorescent light, in
numbers equal to the caster’s CA level. The colours
of the balls may be chosen by the sorcerer. The lights
follow the caster and illume a 5-foot diameter area.
Each ball of <i>witch fire</i> can be sent to cover one Medium
creature or two Small creatures within the spell’s
range, engulfing the target in a phosphorescent glow,
and causing each to suffer a −1 AC penalty. For Large
creatures, the referee must determine a reasonable
size equivalent; e.g., two, three, or four balls of <i>witch
fire</i> may be necessary to affect a giant.</p>"
