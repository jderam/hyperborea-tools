Desc: "<p>Taps the unspeakable power of the Black Gulf, conjuring
a billowing black haze that assumes the vague
shape of a <b>wyvern</b>: a large, two-legged dragon with
a long, barbed tail. The <i>wyvern warden</i> is assigned a
task of guardianship over a person, place, or thing. An
approaching creature will not see the <i>wyvern warden</i>
in the dark unless <i>detect magic</i> is cast. In naturally
lit conditions, however, a wary approaching creature
might discern the hazy, monstrous form.</p>
<p>If anyone or anything approaches within 20 feet of the
curling mass (except designated allies who were present
and identified as such when the spell was cast), the
<i>wyvern warden</i> lashes with its tail, striking without
error. The victim must make a <i>death</i> saving throw or
remain rigid for 1 round per CA level of the sorcerer.
The <i>wyvern warden</i> will then disappear in a puff of
black smoke, able to attack but one victim.</p>
