Desc: "<p>The sorcerer’s face and hands become like those of a
<b>zombie</b>, accompanied by a conspicuous foetor and an
aura of undeath, allowing one to pass amongst unintelligent
undead without notice. This mien is merely a
necromantic illusion, however. Ordinary animals that
glimpse the sorcerer must make morale checks at −2
or flee in terror for 1d4 rounds. <i>Zombie visage</i> is broken
by <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>dispel phantasm</i>; a <i>turn undead</i>
attempt versus <i>Undead Type 2</i>, if successful, will cause
the face to crumble and fall away from the sorcerer.</p>"
