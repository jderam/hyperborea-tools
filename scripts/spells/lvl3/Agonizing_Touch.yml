Desc: "<p>When touched by the sorcerer, a searing pain runs
through the victim’s nervous system; no saving throw
applies. Damage inflicted is 1d4 hp, but the intense
pain impairs the victim for 1d4+1 rounds: The victim’s
attack rolls, armour class, and saving throws are each
at a −2 penalty; movement is halved; and spells or innate
sorcerous abilities stand a 3-in-6 chance of failure
(the optional <i>concentration</i> rule does not apply).</p>"
