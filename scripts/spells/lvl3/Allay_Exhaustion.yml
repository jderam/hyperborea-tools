Desc: "<p>Creates the illusion of healing, wellness, energy, and
stamina. <i>Allay exhaustion</i> allows one to persevere
without sleep when thoroughly exhausted, as though an
<i>extraordinary feat of constitution</i> had been achieved.
As well, any previous hit point loss is temporarily
healed by 50%. The exact number should be recorded,
for when the spell’s duration elapses, this illusory hit
point boon is lost. Once the illusion ends, the recipient
must rest for 12 turns (2 hours) or suffer −4 penalties
to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Unwilling
recipients are allowed <i>sorcery</i> saving throws,
modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.</p>"
