Desc: "<p>Raised are the bones or carrion of Medium animals:
amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles of natural
sort. The <b>medium undead animals</b> will obey the simple
instructions of the caster (essentially one-word commands)
and follow the sorcerer unless slain or <i>turned</i>;
the <i>dispel magic</i> spell also nullifies the connexion betwixt
the sorcerer and the undead animal. The caster
can <i>animate</i> and maintain no more than 2 HD of undead
animals per CA level. <i>Animated carrion</i> loses any special
abilities possessed in life (e.g., flight, musk, venom).</p>"
