Desc: "<p><b>Skeletons</b> or <b>zombies</b> are created from the bones and
cadavers of dead humans or humanoids. The undead
will obey the commands of the caster, following, attacking,
or standing guard as directed. They will continue
to serve until slain or <i>turned</i>; the <i>dispel magic</i> spell
also nullifies the connexion betwixt the sorcerer and
the undead. Through this necromancy the sorcerer
can <i>animate</i> and maintain <b>1 skeleton</b> or <b>zombie</b> per
CA level. If suitable remains are at hand, the sorcerer
can opt to raise <b>1 large skeleton</b> per 3 CA levels, or
<b>1 giant skeleton</b> per 6 CA levels, though zombies may
only be created from the whole corpses of humans.</p>"
