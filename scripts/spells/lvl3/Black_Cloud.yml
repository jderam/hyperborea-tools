Desc: "<p>A small raincloud appears 30–60 feet above the intended
target area. It releases a torrent of rain that forms
a cylinder, showering a 30-foot-diameter area. If this
spell is cast in an area of subfreezing temperature, the
precipitation instead will be heavy snow; or, if the temperature
is just at the freezing point, sleet and freezing
rain results.</p>
<p>All attack rolls made whilst under a <i>black cloud</i> are
at −4 “to hit” penalties. Normal fires will be extinguished;
magical fires will be temporarily snuffed,
their dweomers rekindling 1 turn after the spell terminates
(unless their durations elapse). <i>Black cloud</i> can
also be used as a protective measure, for if a <i>fireball</i>,
<i>flaming sphere</i>, or similar effect strikes the deluged
area, the fire spell will be extinguished, and the rain
vaporized to a cloud of steam.</p>"
