Desc: "<p>Evokes a flashing, 20-foot-diameter sphere of brilliant
white radiance. Creatures within the area of effect are
subject to blindness unless they make <i>sorcery</i> saving
throws (or unless their eyes are closed). Creatures of
3 HD or fewer are permanently blinded if they fail
their saves; creatures of 4–6 HD are blinded for 2d4
rounds; and creatures of 7 HD or greater are blinded
for 1d4+1 rounds. Blinded creatures always lose initiative
and suffer −4 penalties on attack rolls, armour
class, and saving throws. Creatures not within the radius
of the spell, and those that make their saves, will
see spots for 1d6 turns.</p>"
