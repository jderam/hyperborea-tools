Desc: "<p>Randomly the sorcerer “blinks” in and out of existence,
making short (2d4-foot) planar jumps through
the Æther and back. The caster may attack whilst
<i>blinking</i> (if within range), but at a −4 “to hit” penalty.
If the caster wins initiative, all melee and missile attacks
against him or her will automatically miss. If the
caster loses initiative, he or she is subject to attack,
though only once from each attacker. The caster can
be targeted by area effect spells such as <i>fireball</i> or <i>web</i>,
or by breath weapons, if the original position and the
<i>blink</i> location are both within the area of effect. The
direction of the <i>blink</i> is determined by a d8 roll:</p>
<ol>
<li>north</li>
<li>northeast</li>
<li>east</li>
<li>southeast</li>
<li>south</li>
<li>southwest</li>
<li>west</li>
<li>northwest</li>
</ol>
<p>If a solid object blocks the <i>blink</i> location, the sorcerer
will be displaced as far as 15 feet in the determined direction
in order to reappear. If solid matter still blocks
re-emergence, the sorcerer will be trapped in another
dimension, perhaps the plane where dwells Kraken.</p>"
