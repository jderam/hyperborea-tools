Desc: "<p>Requiring 1 turn to evoke, this spell is cast outdoors
and is contingent on the presence of a thunderstorm,
rainstorm, or significantly cloudy conditions. The sorcerer
can then <i>call lightning</i> to strike a target within
360 feet. The lightning inflicts 2d8 hp base damage
plus 1d8 hp per CA level (e.g., a CA 5 caster calls a
7d8 hp lightning bolt) to the target and any other
creature within a 10-foot radius. A successful <i>sorcery</i>
saving throw reduces damage by half. The sorcerer
may continue to call down another lightning bolt every
12 rounds (2 minutes) until the spellâ€™s duration elapses
(i.e., one bolt per CA level) without need of concentration;
the sorcerer can cast other spells, move, engage
in melee, and so forth.</p>"
