Desc: "<p>This spell allows the caster to feign death in a way indistinguishable
from actual mortification. The sorcerer’s
invisible spirit can float up to six feet above their “dead”
physical body. The caster can see, hear, smell, and perceive
surrounding events; meanwhile, no pulse is discernible
on the cataleptic body, no breath appears to be
drawn, and flesh is cold to the touch. One can willingly
emerge from the <i>cataleptic state</i> at any time but needs
1 full turn before being able to walk and talk as normal.</p>"
