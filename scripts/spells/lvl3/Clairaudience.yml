Desc: "<p>The caster envisions a known or familiar location and
can “hear” any sounds within 60 feet of the location’s
epicentre. Range is not a factor when casting this spell,
so long as the caster is on the same planet, plane of
existence, and dimension as the targeted location. As a
few examples, a familiar location may be construed as
behind a door before which the caster stands, within a
cave entrance the caster views, or in a patch of brush
the caster spies from a precipice above. If <i>clairaudience</i>1q
is used to listen in on one who is 10 HD or greater,
the target may make a <i>sorcery</i> save to cognize the
effect; otherwise, they are ignorant. Lastly, if used in
conjunction with the <i>clairvoyance</i> spell, the sorcerer
both hears and sees the envisioned location.</p>"
