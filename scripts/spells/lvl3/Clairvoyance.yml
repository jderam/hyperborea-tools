Desc: "<p>The caster envisions a known or familiar location and
can “see” anything within 60 feet of the location’s
epicentre, beyond which all sight becomes blurred; if
the area is cloaked in darkness, visibility is limited to
10 feet. Range is not a factor when casting this spell,
so long as the caster is on the same planet, plane of
existence, and dimension as the targeted location.
If <i>clairvoyance</i> is used to view one who is 10 HD or
greater, the target may make a <i>sorcery</i> save to cognize
the effect; otherwise, they are ignorant. Lastly, if used
in conjunction with <i>clairaudience</i>, the sorcerer both
hears and sees the envisioned location.</p>"
