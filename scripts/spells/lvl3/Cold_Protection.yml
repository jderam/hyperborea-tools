Desc: "<p>Shelters the caster or other recipient from any damage
related to normal cold for one hour per CA level.
Against magical cold (e.g., <i>cone of cold</i>, <i>freezing sphere</i>,
a <b>winter wolfâ€™s</b> breath), the sorcerer gains immunity
from a single attack before the spell is broken; a recipient
of this spell other than the sorcerer simply gains
a +4 saving throw bonus versus magical cold attacks.</p>"
