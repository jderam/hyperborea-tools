Desc: "<p>Creates a 60-foot-diameter sphere of gloom as black as
pitch. It cannot be cast on a single target or object, but
rather on an area. Torch and lantern light are rendered
ineffective, and <i>infrared vision</i> is futile. The effect is
permanent (unless <i>dispelled</i>), so long as the caster remains
within 10 miles; otherwise, the dweomer begins
to dissipate in subtle degrees, ending in a number of
months equal to the sorcererâ€™s CA. <i>Continuous darkness</i>
can counter <i>continuous light</i> and <i>light</i>.</p>"
