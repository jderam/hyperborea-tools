Desc: "<p>Nourishing food and water are created by the sorcerer,
enough to feed one person per CA level. (For the purpose
of this spell, consider a horse or camel equivalent
to three people.) The conjured food is always fresh
(not dried or preserved) and thus subject to spoilage
unless <i>purify food and drink</i> is also cast.</p>"
