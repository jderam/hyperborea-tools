Desc: "<p>The caster or other willing recipient is cooled to
sub-zero temperatures, effectively frozen solid and
preserved. The recipient of this spell enters a coma
from which it cannot be revived until the spell’s duration
is met. Furthermore, the recipient appears dead,
frozen by natural or sorcerous means, with no discernible
pulse. Thawing begins about four hours before the
spell’s termination. When the spell ends, the recipient
(if intelligent) requires 1d6 turns before it can begin
walking and talking as normal.</p>
<p><i>Cryonic state</i> can be used to preserve one who is about
to die of poison, blood loss, etc. Too, this spell may be
cast on an unwilling target that is sleeping. The target
is allowed a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw to negate the effect
and abruptly awaken; otherwise, it suffers the effects
described above.</p>"
