Desc: "<p>Remedies nearly all forms of hearing loss unless the
eardrums themselves have been destroyed. The reverse
of this spell, <i>inflict deafness</i>, renders its victim unable
to hear unless a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw is made. A deaf
creature is surprized on a base 4-in-6 chance and suffers
an individual initiative penalty of −2 (i.e., the deaf
creature may lose initiative, despite its allies winning).
Other penalties may apply at the referee’s discretion.</p>"
