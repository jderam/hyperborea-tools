Desc: "<p>Remedies nearly all forms of illness. The subject is
alleviated of all debilitating effects within 1d6 rounds.
The reverse of this spell, <i>inflict disease</i>, delivers a malady
that drains the strength and vitality of its victim if
a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw is not made. The disease manifests
in 1d6 turns; once it does, the afflicted lose 1 hp
per turn and 1 point of strength per hour until total hit
points are reduced to one-tenth of normal and strength
is reduced to one-third of normal. If the afflicted is not
cured within three weeks, a loss of 1 constitution point
per day is suffered until that attribute is reduced to
one-third of normal. If untreated, the victim will likely
die within a year.</p>"
