Desc: "<p>Using a small blade, the sorcerer begins chanting this
spell whilst excising the face of a deceased human or
humanoid, providing the subject has died within the
hour (6 turns). Continuing these baleful incantations,
the dead skin mask is applied to the face of the sorcerer
or to a willing recipient. The necromantic graft
duplicates the deceased creature’s face with macabre
exactitude. <i>Death masque</i> thus requires 2 turns to
cast. It can be discerned with <i>true seeing</i>, and it can be
terminated via <i>dispel magic</i>. When the spell’s duration
expires, the dead face will rot and peel painfully off the
recipient’s face, causing 1d6 hp damage.</p>"
