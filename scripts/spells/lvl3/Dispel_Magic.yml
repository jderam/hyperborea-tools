Desc: "<p>Sorcery and its effects are negated and removed in an
area of 20 × 20 × 20 feet. The spell does not negate
magic items but can undo a sorcerous effect created by
one. It does not, however, negate illusions/phantasms.
If <i>dispel magic</i> is used against a spell cast by a sorcerer
of higher CA, the chance of failure is 1-in-20 per
level difference. For instance, if a CA 6 caster attempts
to <i>dispel</i> the <i>levitate</i> spell of a CA 10 sorcerer, there is
a 4-in-20 chance of failure.</p>"
