Desc: "<p>Automatically negates any illusions/phantasms. However,
if used against the illusion/phantasm spell of a superior
illusionist, the chance of failure is 1-in-20 per CA
level difference. For instance, if a CA 6 bard attempts
to <i>dispel phantasm</i> against the <i>spectral phantasm</i> of a
CA 10 illusionist, then the bard stands a 4-in-20 chance
of failure.</p>"
