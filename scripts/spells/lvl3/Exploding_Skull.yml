Desc: "<p>On the clean skull of a human or humanoid, the sorcerer
places a ward that persists for 1 turn or until
touched by another living creature. If the skull is
touched by someone other than the caster, or at the
end of the spellâ€™s duration in any case, it explodes
with waves of negative energy from the Black Gulf.
The blast affects a 25-foot radius. Any creature within
range of the blast suffers 1d6 hp damage per CA level
of the sorcerer unless a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw is made
for half damage. The <i>exploding skull</i> can be hurled as
a grenade to equal effect, the skull detonating upon impact.
This is executed by use of the <i>flask hurling</i> rules
(see <b>Chapter 9: Combat</b>, <i>combat options</i>).</p>"
