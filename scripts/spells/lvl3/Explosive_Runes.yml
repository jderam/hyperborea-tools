Desc: "<p>Sorcerous symbols are inscribed on the surface of a
book, manual, map, note, scroll, tome, or other written
work. The <i>explosive runes</i> protect the volumeâ€™s content
so that only the sorcerer who inscribed the <i>runes</i> may
access the material safely. If the reader is not the caster,
the <i>runes</i> will explode for 5d6 hp damage. The reader
is permitted no saving throw, but those within 10 feet
are allowed <i>sorcery</i> saving throws for half damage.
Sorcerers who carefully inspect the volume (before
simply reading it) have a 1-in-20 chance per CA level of
discovering the <i>explosive runes</i>. <i>Explosive runes</i> can be
removed at any time by the caster or the <i>dispel magic</i>
spell. Detonation effectively destroys the material.</p>"
