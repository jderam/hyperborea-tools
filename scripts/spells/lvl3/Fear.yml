Desc: "<p>The eyes of the sorcerer assume kaleidoscopic aspect
as they emit an invisible cone 5 feet wide at its base and
30 feet wide at its terminus. Within this area of effect,
creatures of 5 HD or fewer must make <i>sorcery</i> saving
throws or flee in panic for the duration of the spell; if
they have nowhere to flee, they will cower in a corner.
Creatures of 6 HD or more save at +4. Saving throws
are modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.
Fear victims drop anything they hold on a 3-in-6 chance.</p>"
