Desc: "<p>Shelters the caster or other recipient from any damage
related to normal fire for one hour per CA level. Against
magical fire (e.g., <i>fireball</i>, a <b>hell houndâ€™s</b> breath, a <b>flame
tongue</b> sword), the sorcerer gains immunity from a single
attack before the spell is broken; a recipient of this
spell other than the sorcerer simply gains a +4 saving
throw bonus versus magical fire attacks.</p>"
