Desc: "<p>A quarterstaff must be gripped in the outstretched
hands of the sorcerer. Upon speaking the incantation,
the ends of the staff emit bright orange flames, effecting
light in a 60-foot radius. The quarterstaff becomes
a temporary magical weapon (+1 “to hit”) and inflicting
2d6 hp damage per hit (1d6 hp staff damage, 1d6
hp fire damage); undead suffer an additional 1d6 hp
fire damage (3d6 hp total). Too, bonus damage for high
strength may be applied. By gripping it with two hands
and speaking a command, the caster may also use the
<i>fire staff</i> to fly at a rate of 60 MV. <i>N.B.:</i> If this spell is
cast on a quarterstaff that is already enchanted, the
+1 “to hit” bonus is not cumulative.</p>"
