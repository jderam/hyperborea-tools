Desc: "<p>From the palm of the sorcererâ€™s hand shoots a fiery
missile that explodes into a 40-foot-diameter sphere of
flames when it strikes a target designated by the caster.
Damage is 1d6 hp per CA level to all within the area
of effect; e.g., a CA 5 sorcerer creates a 5d6 hp <i>fireball</i>.
Targets may make <i>sorcery</i> saves for half damage.
<i>N.B.:</i> The <i>fireball</i> must occupy its full volume (~33,500
cubic feet); if cast in an enclosed area smaller than the
40-foot diameter sphere, the flames expand as necessary
into halls, tunnels, closets, through windows, etc.</p>"
