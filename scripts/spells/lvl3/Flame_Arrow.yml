Desc: "<p>Enchants one arrow or crossbow bolt per round for as
many rounds as the sorcerer has CA levels. The caster
must touch each missile, which then must be fired
(presumably by an ally) within 1 round of the sorcererâ€™s
touch. Once a <i>flame arrow</i> is launched, it ignites,
causing an extra 1d6 hp fire damage if it strikes its
intended target. Each enchanted missile is considered
a magical weapon, though it has no attack bonus.</p>"
