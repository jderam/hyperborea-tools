Desc: "<p>Imbues the clean skull of a human or humanoid with
sorcerous power. The <i>floating skull</i> emanates a soft,
violet glow as it floats over the caster’s shoulder, where
it continues to hover for the duration of the spell, following
the sorcerer’s every move. If the caster stops,
closes his or her eyes, and concentrates, the <i>floating
skull</i> may be sent forth to serve as new set of “eyes,”
so to speak. The <i>skull</i> floats at 30 MV to as far as 120
feet away from the stationary sorcerer. The <i>floating
skull</i> can see 30 feet away and does so with <i>infrared
vision</i> (q.v.) if exploring in the dark. If attacked, the
skull is AC 7 and is destroyed by a single hit.</p>"
