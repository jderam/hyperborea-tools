Desc: "<p>Solidifies water to eight-inch thickness in a 420 Ã— 420-foot
area. The frozen surface can be safely traversed
if anchored to land; otherwise, it will float. <i>Freeze surface</i>
can be enchanted to be rough or mirror smooth,
the latter of which can be quite slippery. The sorcerer
can end this spell with a flick of his hand, or the ice will
melt naturally, as determined by the climate.</p>"
