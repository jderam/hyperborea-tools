Desc: "<p>Protects a box, chest, door, gate, portcullis, or another
portal from unauthorized entry. This spell requires the
use of crushed gem of at least 100-gp value. The sorcerer
needs 2 turns to trace the <i>glyph</i>, which becomes
invisible upon completion. The <i>glyph</i> can be discovered
by spells such as <i>detect invisibility</i> or <i>detect magic</i>, or
possibly by a thief searching for traps. The dweomer
is placed with a code word that prevents it from discharging.
The caster may supply allies with this code
word, which must be spoken before the warded portal
is opened or passed through.</p>
<p>If an unauthorized creature triggers the <i>glyph</i>, one of
the following effects occurs, selected by the sorcerer at
the time of casting:</p>
<ul><li>1d4 hp damage per CA level of cold,
fire, or electrical damage (a blast effect)</li>
<li><i>inflict blindness</i> (reversed form of
<i>cure blindness</i> [q.v.])</li>
<li><i>inflict deafness</i> (reversed form of
<i>cure deafness</i> [q.v.])</li>
<li><i>cause paralysis</i> (reversed form of
<i>remove paralysis</i> [q.v.])</li></ul>
<p>Each effect detonates in a five-foot radius per CA
level. A successful <i>sorcery</i> saving throw negates each
<i>cause/inflict</i> effect and reduces the three blast effects
(cold, fire, electricity) to half damage.</p>"
