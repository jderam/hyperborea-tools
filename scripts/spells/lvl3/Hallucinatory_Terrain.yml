Desc: "<p>Conjures an illusory landscape that conceals the actual
topography. A meadow, for instance, might be made to
appear as a forest, a hill, a river, a swamp, or the like.
The maximum size of the illusion is a cube with sides
five feet long per CA level; e.g., a CA 8 sorcerer can
effect a 40 × 40 × 40-foot illusion. The <i>hallucinatory
terrain</i> persists until some portion of it is forcibly
shaken or struck by an intelligent creature, or unless
<i>dispel phantasm</i> is cast.</p>"
