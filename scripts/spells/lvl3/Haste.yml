Desc: "<p>Doubled are the attack and movement rates of this
spell’s recipients; unwilling targets are allowed <i>sorcery</i>
saving throws. The caster selects a target point
and <i>hastens</i> a number of creatures equal to his or her
CA level in a 15-foot radius. Those closest to the centre
of the circle are affected first, potentially including the
sorcerer’s enemies; however, the caster can limit the
radius of the spell, shrinking it as desired. <i>Hastened</i>
creatures can move at double their normal rates and
make twice as many attacks per combat round:</p>
<ul><li>1/1 attack rate becomes 2/1</li>
<li>3/2 attack rate becomes 3/1</li>
<li>2/1 attack rate becomes 4/1</li>
<li>5/2 attack rate becomes 5/1</li>
<li>3/1 attack rate becomes 6/1</li></ul>
<p>Sorcery (spells and magical devices) is not <i>hastened</i>
in any way. This spell cannot be “stacked” with other
spells or magic items that increase speed. Once the duration
is met, recipients of <i>haste</i> are aged by one year
as a result of this spell, unless a <i>transformation</i> saving
throw is made. <i>Haste</i> counteracts the <i>slow</i> spell, but
this usage does not bring about the ageing side effect.</p>"
