Desc: "<p>Freezes still (i.e., motionless, paralyzed) up to six Medium
animals (amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, and
reptiles). The enchantment affects mundane animals
only, not magical or supernatural beasts. It can be
cast at a single animal or a group of animals, so long
as they are within a 20-foot radius of the primary target,
which must be selected by the caster. Large and
Small animals may be <i>held</i>, too. Three Small animals
may be considered equivalent to one Medium animal,
and one Large animal may be considered equivalent
to three Medium animals. When cast at a group, the
spell affects those animals closest to the primary
target selected by the caster. Each beast is allowed a
<i>sorcery</i> saving throw to resist the spell, but if the spell
is focused on a single animal, its saving throw is made
at a âˆ’2 penalty.</p>"
