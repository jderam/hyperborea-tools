Desc: "<p>A message, instructions, or a map is penned in a script
that only the sorcerer and the desired recipient(s) can
read and understand. Another illusionist (or associated
subclass) will cognize the <i>illusory script</i> for what it
is but will be unable to comprehend it. Any attempt to
read the script requires a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, or else
the reader becomes <i>confused</i> (as the <i>confusion</i> spell
[q.v.]) for 1d6 rounds. The saving throw is modified by
<i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable. This spell breaks
if the source material (e.g., book, parchment, scroll) is
physically destroyed or if <i>dispel phantasm</i> is cast on it.</p>"
