Desc: "<p>Creates a phantasm of a flaming barricade. The <i>illusory
wall of fire</i> can be as large as 1 × 10 × 10 feet and is
realistic to the eyes and ears, but it does not emit actual
heat; the thermal properties of this spell are purely deceptive.
The <i>illusory wall of fire</i> can be passed through,
but such transit will not terminate it. The spell persists
for its duration unless <i>dispel phantasm</i> is cast. Creatures
that pass through the <i>illusory wall of fire</i> must
make <i>sorcery</i> saving throws (modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable) or suffer 2d6 hp damage
(manifesting actual burn wounds). If a creature becomes
aware of the deception and gives warning, allies
can attempt to pass through with +4 bonuses to their
saves. Creatures of an innately fiery nature (such as <b>fire
elementals</b>) are never fooled by this spell.</p>"
