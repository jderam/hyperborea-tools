Desc: "<p>The sorcerer is protected from projectiles with shafts
of wood. Arrows, bolts, javelins, and spears launched
at the caster will <i>incinerate</i> within 10 feet of the sorcerer.
Magical missiles are less likely to be affected:
+1 missiles will <i>incinerate</i> on a 3-in-6 chance, +2
missiles on a 2-in-6 chance, and +3 missiles on a 1-in-6
chance; missiles greater than +3 are unaffected. The
same chance applies to mundane missiles fired from a
magical launcher (e.g., if a <b>+2 short bow</b> fires a normal
arrow, the arrow will <i>incinerate</i> on a 2-in-6 chance).</p>"
