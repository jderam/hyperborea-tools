Desc: "<p>This spell, usable only in combat, allows the player to
ask the referee, once per round during <i>action declaration</i>,
about the immediate intentions of a selected
creature. The referee must answer honestly (possibly
by passing a note to the player and leaving it to the
player’s discretion to describe). In effect, the caster
can see what the creature intends to do next.</p>
<p>The caster must choose a target creature within the
spell’s range. Then, with eyes closed tight, the caster
becomes attuned to mystical strings that permeate the
Black Gulf. As long as the caster’s eyes remain closed,
what is seen with the <i>inner eye</i> can be verbalized. In
effect, the caster grants party members a bonus to
rolls specifically related to the creature’s action. This
advantage can take the form of +2 “to hit,” +2 AC,
or a +2 saving throw bonus, as selected by the sorcerer
(e.g., a caster who uses this spell to see that a
<b>mountain ape</b> will swing at the thief—and announces
that vision aloud—could grant +2 to the thief ’s AC, or
perhaps +2 to the thief ’s counterattack).</p>
<p>Once a target is selected, the caster must keep his
or her eyes closed, or the spell ends. If the selected
creature is killed or otherwise subdued, the caster
may switch focus to the next closest enemy, blinking
their eyes open for a second for targeting purposes.
Otherwise, the caster is effectively blind throughout
the duration (−4 penalties to AC and saving throws).</p>"
