Desc: "<p>Functions much as the <i>invisibility</i> spell (q.v.), except
that it extends in a 10-foot-radius hemisphere from the
primary recipient, potentially causing other creatures
in the spell’s radius to become invisible. The <i>invisibility
hemisphere</i> moves with the primary recipient.
Those within 10 feet at the time of casting (including
animal companions, undead minions, etc.) become
invisible, but they can see one another as translucent
figures. If a beneficiary of this spell steps out from its
radius, that one will become visible, unable to resume
<i>invisibility</i> unless the spell is recast. If the primary
recipient causes damage (hp loss) to another creature,
or causes another creature to roll a saving throw, the
entire spell is negated; however, if one of the spell’s
other recipients causes damage (or forces a saving
throw) to an opponent, only that actor becomes visible.
For more examples of what constitutes harm, see the
<i>invisibility</i> spell.</p>"
