Desc: "<p>A bolt of lightning 5 feet wide and 60 feet long erupts
from the outstretched hands of the sorcerer, striking
all within its path until it reaches maximum range.
Struck creatures suffer 1d6 hp damage per CA level,
with <i>sorcery</i> saving throws allowed for half damage.</p>
<p>The <i>lightning bolt</i> will travel its full range of 180 feet
before ceasing; if it strikes a wall or another solid surface
before reaching its 180-foot range, it will rebound,
potentially striking again those within its path—and
possibly the caster. For example, if a CA 9 sorcerer casts
this spell whilst in the doorway of a 70 × 70-foot room,
the <i>bolt</i> will strike its targets for 9d6 hp damage, strike
the far wall, bounce back, hit the targets again (they get
another saving throw for half damage), strike the caster,
and then travel another 40 feet before dissipating.</p>"
