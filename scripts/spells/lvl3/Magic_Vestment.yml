Desc: "<p>Conjures a translucent suit of chain mail (AC 5,
DR 1) to bedeck the sorcerer or another willing recipient.
The armour has no weight, though it rattles like
ghostly chains whenever the recipient moves. <i>Magic
vestment</i> cannot be “stacked” with other armour,
though the wearer can bear a shield or enjoy other
forms of magical protection.</p>"
