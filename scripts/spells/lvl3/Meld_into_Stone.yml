Desc: "<p>The sorcerer or other willing recipient melds into a large
stone. The subject can carry no more than 100 pounds of
inanimate gear, and the stone must be of equal or greater
size as the recipient, or the spell will fail. The subject
may step out of the stone at any time. If the subject does
not exit the stone before the spell terminates, he or she
must make a <i>transformation</i> save or remain forever
trapped, their face and upper torso vaguely distinguishable
in the stoneâ€™s form. If the saving throw succeeds, it
must be rolled once per additional turn spent within the
stone. A trapped victim can be saved by a <i>stone to flesh</i>
spell, their body tearing out from a sort of fleshy egg, or
by a <i>dispel magic</i> spell.</p>"
