Desc: "<p>Detoxifies a poisoned victim. If used within 6 rounds
(1 minute) on a creature killed by poison, the victim will
be revived to 0 hp, pending a <i>trauma survival</i> check
(see <b>Chapter 3: Statistics</b>, <i>constitution</i>). This spell
can also detoxify a venomous creature (snake, spider,
etc.) with a successful touch attack. The creature is
afforded a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw to negate the effect
(and, given sufficient time, will eventually regenerate
its venom sacs). <i>Neutralize poison</i> can likewise purify
other poisonous or poisoned objects such as food,
plants, and the like.</p>
<p>The reverse of this spell, <i>poison</i>, is delivered via a
touch attack. The victim is allowed a <i>death</i> (poison)
saving throw. If the saving throw is successful, the victim
sustains 2d6 hp damage; if the saving throw fails,
the victim falls deathly ill, suffering fever and delirium
within 1 turn, paralysis after 6 turns (1 hour), and
death in 48 hours.</p>"
