hands (at the time of casting) become invisible to spells
that would scry their location for the duration of the
spell, including <i>clairaudience</i>, <i>clairvoyance</i>, and <i>extrasensory
perception</i>, and likewise any spells that
<i>detect</i> or <i>discern</i>. Furthermore, any scrying devices
such as <b>crystal balls</b>, <b>wands of magic detection</b>, and
the like are ineffective.</p>"
