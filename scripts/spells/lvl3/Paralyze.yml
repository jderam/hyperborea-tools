Desc: "<p>The illusion of immobilization overcomes the minds
of those victims who fail their <i>sorcery</i> saving throws,
modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable. The
caster can affect 2 HD of opponents for every CA level,
targeting a single individual or a 20 × 20-foot area;
when used in an area of effect, the lowest HD creatures
are always affected first. Should the caster wish
to target but one creature, its <i>sorcery</i> saving throw is
at a −2 penalty. This spell can be negated by <i>dispel
magic</i>, <i>dispel phantasm</i>, or <i>remove paralysis</i>.</p>"
