Desc: "<p>The recipient of this spell and all within 15 feet can
move through wilderness terrain—be it forest, desert,
or snowy mountainside—without leaving a footprint,
a scent, or other trace, regardless of armour worn.
A tracker has no chance to find a trail; however, should
one cast <i>detect magic</i>, a faint trail of magical footprints
will be discerned, enduring for 6 turns (1 hour) after
the spell’s recipients have passed.</p>"
