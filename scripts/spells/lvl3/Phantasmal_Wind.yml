Desc: "<p>Invokes from the Black Gulf a gust of phantom wind
that is neither seen nor felt, yet can extinguish torches,
fan flames, rustle flags, or disperse spells such as
<i>cloudkill</i> and <i>fog cloud</i>. <i>Phantasmal wind</i> blows in the
direction the caster points, wafting at 30 MV from the
time it is cast and petering out at the spellâ€™s maximum
range. At its greatest effectiveness, this dweomer can
belly the sail of a small craft.</p>"
