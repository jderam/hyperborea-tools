Desc: "<p>Formed from the shadow-stuff of the Black Gulf is a
quasi-real, equine mount for the caster or other recipient.
Requiring 1 turn to materialize, the beast is
smoky grey to black in colour, with pale white eyes.
The <i>phantom steed</i> makes no sound as it moves, and its
shadowy hooves never touch the ground. If the caster
has CA 8 or greater, the <i>phantom steed</i> can cross muddy,
sandy, or swampy terrain uninhibited; at CA 10 or
greater, it can pass over water as though it were solid
ground; and at CA 12, the <i>phantom steed</i> can walk on
air (though not fly, per se), able to cross a chasm or
crevasse as though a solid bridge were present.</p>
<p>Normal animals may shew uneasiness in the <i>phantom
steed’s</i> presence. The <i>phantom steed</i> is incapable of
combat, but it can be attacked. Its relevant statistics
are: MV 60; AC 7; HD 2; #A 0; D —; SV 16. It cannot
