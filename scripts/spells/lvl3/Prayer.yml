Desc: "<p>The sorcerer chants eldritch invocations that effect a
potent benison to allies—and a malison to enemies—
within a 25-foot radius. Allies gain +1 “to hit,” +1
damage, and +1 to saving throws; enemies are penalized
−1 “to hit,” −1 damage, and −1 saving throws.
The bonuses/penalties persist as long as the caster
continues to chant and 3 rounds after ceasing to chant.
<i>Dispel magic</i> or <i>silence</i> can break this spell.</p>"
