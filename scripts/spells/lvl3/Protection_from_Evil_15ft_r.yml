Desc: "<p>A pale, 15-foot-radius circle of light surrounds the
caster, preventing summoned creatures (e.g., dæmons,
elementals) from attacking the sorcerer or any allies
who are within. Against other Evil creatures, the sorcerer
and allies enjoy a +1 bonus to AC, DR, and saving
throws versus their attacks. As the caster moves,
so too does the <i>protection</i> circle. The reverse of this
spell, <i>protection from good, 15΄ r.</i>, is cast by Evil or
Neutral sorcerers; it functions the same way, except
versus creatures of Good alignment.</p>"
