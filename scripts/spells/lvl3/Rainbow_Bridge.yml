Desc: "<p>Evokes a misty, arching rainbow to take form. It can
be used to bridge a chasm, pit, lava pool, or other hazard.
The <i>rainbow bridge</i> is 10 feet wide and can span
15 feet per CA level. The arch has an apex equal to
one-half its length.</p>
<p><i>Rainbow bridge</i> can be traversed as though it were
solid ground at normal walking speed, but running
will cause the crosser to fall through. This spell can be
negated by <i>dispel phantasm</i>. The sorcerer cannot end
the spell prematurely; i.e., once cast it persists until its
duration expires.</p>"
