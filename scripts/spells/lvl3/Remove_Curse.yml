Desc: "<p>Permanently wipes away a malediction suffered by
a human or another creature, though not the cursed
enchantments of swords, shields, armour, and the like.
The reverse of this spell, <i>bestow curse</i>, is not of permanent
duration; rather, its duration is 1 turn per CA
level. The victim of <i>bestow curse</i> is allowed a <i>sorcery</i>
saving throw to avoid affliction. Typical curses include:</p>
<ul><li>50% chance per round to drop held items</li>
<li>All attack rolls at −4 “to hit”</li>
<li>All saving throws at –4 penalty</li>
<li>Armour class penalized (increased) by 2</li>
<li>One attribute reduced to a score of 3</li></ul>
<p>Some other minor effect can be imagined by the player
with referee approval. The effect must be reasonable.
For example, the victim cannot be turned into a toad;
that outcome must be accomplished via the <i>polymorph
other</i> spell. They might, however, be cursed to grow
the snout of a pig, or be covered head to toe with warts.</p>"
