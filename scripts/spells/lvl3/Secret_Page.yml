Desc: "<p>Alters the contents of a sheet of paper to appear as
something else: A map might be changed to a poem,
an arcane formula to a recipe for soup, and so forth.
With a command word the caster can view the contents
at any time and then allow the dweomer to resume as
before. A <i>secret page</i> cannot be revealed through a
<i>decipher language</i> spell, but <i>detect magic</i> reveals its
magic, and <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>dispel phantasm</i> can nullify
the dweomer; however, if the <i>dispel</i> attempt fails,
the <i>secret page</i> will be destroyed. Note that <i>explosive
runes</i> or a <i>sepia snake sigil</i> may also be inscribed on
a <i>secret page</i>. A sorcerer can maintain as many secret
pages as he or she has CA levels.</p>"
