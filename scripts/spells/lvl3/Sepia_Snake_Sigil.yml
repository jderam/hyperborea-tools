Desc: "<p>The casting of this spell requires snake scales and
powdered amber of 100-gp value. The spell may be
executed via one of three methods:</p>
<ol><li>Glowing sigil drawn in the air and directed at a
target</li>
<li>Grey-brown sigil inscribed upon an object that, if
studied or touched, activates the dweomer</li>
<li>Small character inscribed into a book or
scroll that, if studied or touched, activates the
dweomer</li></ol>
<p>Whichever the method, a brown, serpentine force is
evoked to strike its nearest victim. It attacks at a fighting
ability (FA) equal to the sorcererâ€™s casting ability
(CA). If the <i>sepia snake sigil</i> hits its target, the victim
is imprisoned and paralyzed within a shimmering amber
force field. This lasts until the caster releases the
victim, the caster dies, or <i>dispel magic</i> is cast. No saving
throw is allowed for creatures of 8 HD or less; however,
a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw is allowed for creatures of
9 HD or greater. Nothing can approach an entrapped
victim; all attempts are rebuffed by the force field. The
imprisoned will not age, sleep, nor grow hungry; neither
will it be aware of what transpires without. If the
<i>sepia snake sigil</i> misses its target, it disappears in a
puff of brown smoke.</p>"
