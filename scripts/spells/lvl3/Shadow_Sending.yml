Desc: "<p>By sacrificing a piece of obsidian (volcanic glass) whilst
sitting cross-legged before a fire, the sorcerer’s own
shadow is infused with the negative energy of the
Black Gulf. Once the spell is cast, the sorcerer’s shadow
elongates in any direction (up or down, left or right)
to a length of 90 feet per round; so, a CA 5 sorcerer can
send a shadow forth 450 feet (150 yards) in 5 rounds.
The caster can hear and see through the shadow (even
in natural darkness), but touch is impossible. The shadow
is silent, and for the vigilant it is noticed on a 1-in-10
chance unless under direct sunlight (5-in-10 chance).
It is AC 9 (plus the caster’s <i>defence adjustment</i>, if applicable)
and has 9 hp; however, it is harmed only by
spells, or by silver or magical weapons. If the shadow
is struck, the sorcerer also sustains like damage.</p>"
