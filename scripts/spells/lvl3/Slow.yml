Desc: "<p>Halved are the attack and movement rates of this spell’s
victims who fail their <i>sorcery</i> saving throws. The caster
selects a target point and <i>slows</i> a number of creatures
equal to his or her CA level in a 15-foot radius. Those
closest to the centre of the circle are affected first, potentially
including the sorcerer’s allies; however, the
caster can limit the radius of the spell, shrinking it as
desired. <i>Slowed</i> creatures move at half their normal
rates, lose any dexterity <i>defence adjustment</i> to armour
class, and make half as many attacks per combat round:</p>
<ul><li>1/1 attack rate becomes 1/2</li>
<li>3/2 attack rate becomes 3/4
<i>(1 attack, 1 attack, no attack, 1 attack)</i></li>
<li>2/1 attack rate becomes 1/1</li>
<li>5/2 attack rate becomes 5/4
<i>(1 attack, 1 attack, 1 attack, 2 attacks)</i></li>
<li>3/1 attack rate becomes 3/2
<i>(1 attack, 2 attacks)</i></li>
<li>4/1 attack rate becomes 2/1</li></ul>
<p><i>Slow</i> eliminates the use of the (optional) combat action
<i>two-weapon fighting</i>. Sorcery (spells and magical devices)
is not <i>slowed</i> in any way. <i>Slow</i> counteracts the
<i>haste</i> spell.</p>"
