Desc: "<p>A visual illusion is created, a projected image of nearly
anything the caster can imagine, as large as 40 × 40 × 40
feet in area. Victims must be living creatures of animal
intelligence or greater; undead, constructs, oozes, and
the like are unaffected. <i>Spectral phantasm</i> can be used
to create an attacking monster or another damaging
hazard. The illusion can be of sight, sound, smell, and/or
temperature. The auditory component might include a
shout, a roar, or a sentence of no more than nine words
in length (not including articles <i>a</i>, <i>an</i>, and <i>the</i>).</p>
<p>Once cast, this spell persists as long as the caster concentrates
and for 5 rounds thereafter unless the illusion
is struck for at least 1 hp of damage or is terminated
via a <i>dispel phantasm</i> spell. A <i>spectral phantasmal</i>
monster is AC 7 and will disappear if hit; otherwise,
it can continue to attack as manipulated by the caster.
The illusion can be directed to move anywhere within
the spell’s range; such manoeuvres require the full attention
of the caster, who can walk at half speed and
maintain control.</p>
<p><i>Spectral phantasm</i> targets are not allowed saving
throws unless the referee feels the illusion is unbelievable
to the viewers, in which case <i>sorcery</i> saving
throws should be rolled, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. With sight, sound, smell,
and/or temperature, credibility is rarely an issue
with this spell; if such a case arises, and the save is
made, the disbeliever will see the <i>spectral phantasm</i>
as a flawed and flickering transparent image. An intelligent
disbeliever may then alert allies, whose saves
are made at a bonus of +4. Otherwise, this illusion can
inflict real physical damage: 1d6 hp per CA level per
round to each victim. Such damage remains even if the
spell is subsequently broken.</p>"
