Desc: "<p>This spell only functions amidst vegetation of at least
moderate thickness. It creates within the foliage and
roots a plethora of small, bristly growths in an area as
large as 10 Ã— 10 feet (100 square feet) per CA level.
These spikes may be discerned via <i>detect snares and
pits</i>, <i>detect traps</i>, or <i>true seeing</i>; otherwise, all seems
perfectly natural until the enchanted area is traversed.
For every 10 feet of affected area negotiated, the subject(
s) must make an <i>avoidance</i> saving throw or suffer
1d4 hp damage. The caster can dismiss this spell at will.</p>"
