Desc: "<p>Illumes as large as a 60-foot-diameter area as though it
were under the clearest, brightest <i>starlight</i>. In an area
of utter darkness, visibility will become clear within the
spellâ€™s 60-foot diameter and dim for another 30 feet (so a
120-foot diameter of effectiveness). Stars will appear to
twinkle and shine above the area of effect, be it a 10-foothigh
chamber ceiling or a 60-foot-high cavern roof.</p>"
