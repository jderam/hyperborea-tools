Desc: "<p>Stone is reshaped to fit sorcerer’s purposes. The sorcerer
can manipulate a cubic area with sides of onefoot
length per CA level; e.g., a CA 9 sorcerer can
affect a 9 × 9 × 9-foot area. The <i>stone shape</i> is limited
only by the caster’s imagination. Examples include a
stone chair, club, coffer, door, or statue. The details of
any <i>stone shape</i> lack refinement and are crude by all
accounts. Note that any <i>stone shape</i> with moving parts
stands a 3-in-10 chance of not functioning; e.g., the lid
of a stone coffer might not open.</p>"
