Desc: "<p>From the outstretched hands of the caster emerge a
pair of invisible members which reach for the throat of
a human or humanoid target. The target must make a
<i>sorcery</i> saving throw to negate the effects of this spell.
If the save fails, the victim will choke and gag, suffering
1d4 hp damage per round. The victim furthermore will
fight at −2 “to hit” and damage rolls and may be unable
to cast spells (3-in-6 chance of failure). Too, movement
is halved for the victim. The <i>strangling</i> hands might
be wrenched free via a <i>test of strength</i>. If the victim
has not escaped after 3 rounds of strangulation, then a
<i>test of constitution</i> is required or the victim passes out;
damage continues throughout the duration of the spell.
In addition to the <i>test of strength</i>, escaping <i>strangle</i>
could be done by moving out of range of the caster;
also, <i>dispel magic</i> can break this spell.</p>"
