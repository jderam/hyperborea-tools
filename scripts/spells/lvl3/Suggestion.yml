Desc: "<p>This enchantment affects one creature. The target
must make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable, or be compelled to
carry out a <i>suggestion</i> spoken by the sorcerer. <i>Suggestions</i>
should be neither overly complex nor longer than
one or two sentences, though the victim may attempt
to act upon such urgings for the duration of the spell,
if physically possible. <i>Suggesting</i> an obviously self-destructive
action breaks the spell on a 5-in-6 chance.
Of course, this spell is useless if sorcerer and ensorcelled
do not speak the same language.</p>"
