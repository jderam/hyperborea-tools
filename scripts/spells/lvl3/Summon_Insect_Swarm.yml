Desc: "<p>An angry horde of insects are <i>summoned</i>, manifesting
on the caster’s person, that one’s arms spread wide.
They are flying insects 7-in-10 times; otherwise, they
are crawling. Flying insects, per the referee’s determination,
might be bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps;
crawling insects might include biting ants, beetles, or
non-venomous centipedes. (If this spell is cast underground,
crawling insects will instead be <b>1d4 giant ants</b>,
which will attack normally at the sorcerer’s will.) The
<i>insect swarm</i> will attack 1 round after being <i>summoned</i>.
The standard <i>swarm</i> (not the giant ants) will surge
forth as directed by the sorcerer. As long as the caster
concentrates and points at the target, the victim suffers
2 hp damage per round. Whilst engulfed, the victim
cannot cast spells, missile attacks are impossible,
and melee attacks are at a −4 “to hit” penalty. Other
actions such as drinking a potion, activating a magic
item, using a magic ability, etc. are subject to a 3-in-6
chance of failure. Too, a standard <i>swarm</i> victim suffers
a −4 AC penalty. Fleeing the <i>swarm</i> may be the victim’s
only recourse, for it can harass only to the limit of
the spell’s range. A <i>swarm</i> can be directed to move to
another opponent within range, but 1 round will elapse
for every 30 feet between the targets.</p>"
