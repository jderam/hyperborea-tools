Desc: "<p>A summoned horde of fat, warty toads manifest around
the sorcerer. The <i>toad swarm</i> will attack 1 round after
being summoned, surging forth as directed. The toads
will pursue their target (at 30 MV) to the spell’s range
limit. As long as the caster concentrates and points at
the target, the victim will be assailed by the <i>swarm</i>,
knocked down and overborne by hundreds of amphibians,
unless an <i>avoidance</i> saving throw is made. An
overborne victim is crushed by the unusual weight of
the swarm, sustaining 1d4 hp damage, +1 for each CA
level of the caster per round. For example, a 5th-level
magician’s toad swarm inflicts 1d4+5 hp damage per
round. One may attempt an <i>extraordinary feat of
strength</i> to break free (the referee may need to dice for
the strength score on the spot, using 3d6 or 4d6 drop
low); otherwise, the victim remains <i>prone</i>, unable to
take any other actions. Other methods of escape must
be adjudicated by the referee on a case-by-case basis.
A <i>toad swarm</i> can be directed to hop to another opponent
within range, but 1 round will elapse for every 30
feet between targets.</p>"
