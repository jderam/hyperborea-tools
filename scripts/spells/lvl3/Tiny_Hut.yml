Desc: "<p>A hemispherical globe of force is evoked, surrounding
the sorcerer and providing suitable shelter for as many
as six companions. The <i>tiny hut</i> is 15 feet in base diameter,
with walls that arch to an apex 7½ feet high. It has
an opaque exterior, but from the inside the walls appear
transparent, allowing its inhabitants to see the outdoors
with perfect clarity, unless the caster wills it to opacity.</p>
<p>The <i>tiny hut</i> interior temperature is mild and comfortable
(about 70°F). This condition is maintained so long
as the temperature without is no warmer than 110°F
and no colder than −10°F; for every degree warmer or
colder, the interior temperature of the <i>tiny hut</i> will rise
or drop accordingly. A lambent light emanates from
the interior ceiling upon the command of the caster.</p>
<p>The <i>tiny hut</i> can survive strong winds, rain, sleet, hail,
and snow, but it is vulnerable to attack: If struck, it can
sustain only 6 hp damage before it is destroyed. Whereas
the caster’s companions are free to enter and exit the
<i>tiny hut</i>, once the caster leaves, the spell terminates.</p>"
