Desc: "<p>Enables the sorcerer to speak the language of any
intelligent creature within 50 feet, including secret
languages such as Druidic or Thieves’ Cant. Once the
spell’s duration ends, the caster retains no knowledge
or memory of otherwise unknown languages. The reverse
of this spell, <i>gibberish</i>, confuses and jumbles the
words of all speakers within 50 feet (except those of
the caster), pending individual <i>sorcery</i> saving throws,
modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable. Spells
may also be jumbled to ineffectiveness, but this allows
for a second <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, with +1 for every
CA level of the opposing caster.</p>"
