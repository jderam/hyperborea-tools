Desc: "<p>The sorcerer and all gear assume the form of a small
tree, a shrub, or even a log or stump. Whilst in this
form, a caster can observe all that transpires in a 75-
foot radius unless obstructions are present. This spell
can be ended at will. Only <i>true seeing</i> reveals the <i>tree
shape</i> for what it is.</p>"
