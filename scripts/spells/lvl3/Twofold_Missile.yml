Desc: "<p>The sorcerer must touch a personal missile launcher
to lay this dweomer (usually a bow, crossbow, or sling;
siege weapons do not qualify). On the next round, the
missile launcher will shoot <i>twofold missiles</i>; i.e., when
a missile is fired, sorcery causes the missile to split into
two identical missiles. Only one attack roll is made per
<i>twofold missile</i>: A hit indicates both missiles strike; a
miss indicates both missiles fail to connect. This spell
will duplicate a magically enchanted missile (e.g., a <b>+1
arrow</b> will become two <b>+1 arrows</b>), but in all cases,
only one missile can possibly be recovered, the duplicate
disappearing.</p>"
