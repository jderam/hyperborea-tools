Desc: "<p>With a touch the sorcerer drains a victim of 1d6 hp for
every 2 CA levels, to a maximum of 6d6 hp at CA 12.
The sapped hit points are transferred to the sorcerer.
Temporary hit points are added to the caster’s present
total and will remain for 6 turns (1 hour). During
this period, any damage sustained by the caster is first
subtracted from the temporary total. The temporary
hit points can exceed the caster’s normal maximum
hit point allotment. <i>N.B.:</i> Even if the victim is sapped
beyond death, the same hp are transferred; however,
withering and decay accelerate disturbingly.</p>"
