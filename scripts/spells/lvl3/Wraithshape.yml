Desc: "<p>The sorcerer and all gear assume a smoke-grey, incorporeal
form. Whilst in <i>wraithshape</i>, the undead
(except <b>vampires</b> and <b>liches</b>) will ignore the caster,
believing him or her to be one of their own abysmal
kind. The sorcerer can squeeze under doors or through
small holes or cracks, and he can float in the air at
15 MV. Only magical weapons or spells can harm such
a sorcerer. The sorcerer cannot, however, make any
attacks unless confronted by a creature in a like state.
<i>Dispel magic</i> breaks the spell; otherwise, the sorcerer
can terminate it at will.</p>"
