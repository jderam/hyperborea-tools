Desc: "<p>Black, squid-like tentacles erupt in a 30-foot-diameter
area, one such tentacle per CA level of the sorcerer.
Each thick and slimy tentacle is 10 feet long, AC 4, and
equal in hit points to the sorcerer at full health. Any
creature within range of a <i>black tentacle</i> is subject to
attack; if a tentacle has more than one potential target,
the referee should assign equal chances via random die
roll.</p>
<p>Each victim must make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw. If the
saving throw succeeds, the tentacle lashes the target
for 1d6 hp damage before disappearing. If the saving
throw fails, the tentacle lash delivers 1d6 hp damage,
as well as constricting and rending the victim for a
further 2d6 hp damage per round until the spell ends
or the tentacle is destroyed. As the tentacles have no
intelligence, they will continue to squeeze a dead body
and might on occasion be fooled into constricting a barrel,
statue, tree, or like object.</p>"
