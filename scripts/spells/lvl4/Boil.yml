Desc: "<p>Causes up to two gallons of any liquid to boil. Examples
include water, oil, wine, ale, and blood. Up to 16
flasks (8 oz. each) of liquid can be transformed into
boiling flasks if they are abutting when the spell is
cast. Such a vessel may be hurled as a grenade (<i>flask
hurling</i> rules apply; see <b>Chapter 9: Combat</b>, <i>combat
options</i>) for 1d4 damage per vessel for the duration of
the spell. Note that if a flask of incendiary oil is exposed
to <i>boil</i>, it will detonate straight away. Starting
at CA 7, this spell may be cast at one Small or Medium
living creature. The target must make a <i>death</i> (poison)
saving throw or suffer 2d6 damage per round for the
duration of the spell. Most victims suffer a horrible,
blood-boiling death. A <i>dispel magic</i> spell or ice water
immersion cancels the effects of <i>boil</i>.</p>"
