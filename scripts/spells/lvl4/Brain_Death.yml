Desc: "<p>Kills a small portion of the victim’s neural region related
to memory. The target must be touched and is allowed a
<i>death</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>,
if applicable. If the saving throw is successful, the target
will be aware that foul sorcery had been attempted,
though resisted. If the saving throw fails, the victim will
have no inkling that a spell was cast.</p>
<p>The sorcerer must then describe the memory to be
terminated. The memory is limited to a specific event,
person, place, thing, conversation, or the like. This spell
cannot be used to eradicate an ability; e.g., a farmer cannot
be made to forget how to raise crops, a cleric cannot
be made to forget how to cast spells. If the target rolls
a natural <i>1</i> on the saving throw, a full year of memories
and 1 point of intelligence are lost; this blank is far more
noticeable by the victim’s associates. In either case,
a throbbing headache follows the failed saving throw.</p>"
