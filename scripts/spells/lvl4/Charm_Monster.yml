Desc: "<p>The primary target of this spell (any living creature)
must make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. If the primary target
has 3 HD or fewer, additional targets (also of 3 HD or
fewer) may be affected, starting with those closest to
the primary target. In total, 3d6 individuals of 3 HD or
fewer can be charmed by this spell, so long as they are
within range. Each target is allowed a <i>sorcery</i> saving
throw, as noted above. If the save fails, the sorcerer
is at once regarded as an ally to be trusted and protected.
If communication is possible, the ensorcelled
creature(s) might carry out chores, instructions, or
requests of reasonable nature.</p>
<p>The spell <i>dispel magic</i> can cancel this spell. Otherwise,
each charmed creature is allowed a weekly chance to
break the enchantment:</p>
<ul><li>Victims of 1–2 levels/HD have a 1-in-6 chance</li>
<li>Victims of 3–4 levels/HD have a 2-in-6 chance</li>
<li>Victims of 5–6 levels/HD have a 3-in-6 chance</li>
<li>Victims of 7–8 levels/HD have a 4-in-6 chance</li>
<li>Victims of 9+ levels/HD have a 5-in-6 chance</li></ul>"
