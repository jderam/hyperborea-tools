Desc: "<p>With hands extended, the sorcerer releases a heat-draining
cone 30 feet long and 10 feet wide at its terminus. For
those in its area of effect, the <i>cone of cold</i> drains 1d4+1
hp per CA level, so a 10th-level magician unleashes a
<i>cone of cold</i> that inflicts 10d4+10 hp damage. Victims
are allowed <i>sorcery</i> saving throws for half damage.</p>"
