Desc: "<p>By the sorcerer’s wicked touch, the target of this spell
is weakened and diseased unless a <i>sorcery</i> saving
throw is made. If the save fails, the victim is at once
overcome by a wet cough, skin boils and lesions, loss of
hair, and fatigue. The statistical repercussions include
2 lost points of strength, dexterity, and constitution.
(For ease of game play, an afflicted enemy creature—
human, humanoid, animal, or monster—may suffer
penalties of −1 on attack rolls, −1 damage, −1 AC,
and −1 hp per HD.)</p>
<p>The condition persists unless <i>cure disease</i> is administered,
or until natural healing overcomes the affliction.
Following 4 weeks of bed rest, another saving throw is
permitted. If the victim succeeds, the path to wellness
begins, which requires another 2 weeks before symptoms
and attribute losses are healed. Natural healing,
if the first attempt fails, may be attempted again after
8 weeks and 12 weeks of bed rest. Beyond 12 weeks,
the condition is terminal, and the victim will die of the
<i>contagion</i> within 1d4 years.</p>"
