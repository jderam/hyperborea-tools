Desc: "<p>This specialized <i>fireball</i> spell allows the sorcerer to
increase or decrease the blast diameter by 10-foot
increments. From the palm of the sorcererâ€™s hand
shoots a fiery missile which explodes into a sphere of
flames at a target determined by the caster. Damage is
1d6 hp per CA level to all within the area of effect unless
<i>sorcery</i> saving throws are made for half damage.</p>
<p>A standard blast is 40 feet in diameter, but the diameter
of a <i>controlled blast fireball</i> can be reduced to 30
feet, 20 feet, or as little as 10 feet without decreasing
the potency of the blast. To increase blast size, one die
of damage is sacrificed for every 10 feet of diameter
added, to a maximum possible diameter of 80 feet. So,
a CA 7 sorcerer can fire a standard 7d6 hp <i>fireball</i> that
encompasses a 40-foot-diameter area, or elect to cast
a 50-foot-diameter <i>fireball</i> for 6d6 hp damage, or a
60-foot-diameter <i>fireball</i> for 5d6 hp damage, and so on.</p>"
