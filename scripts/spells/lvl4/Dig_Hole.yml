Desc: "<p>Causes the caster’s hands to transform into enormous,
outwards-turning paws with long nails; meantime,
the head elongates and becomes pointed like that of a
mole, whilst the legs become short and thick. At once
the sorcerer may begin to excavate earth, sand, or
mud, scooping 125 cubic feet (5 × 5 × 5 feet) of earth
per round, using their oversized paws. Any creature
that approaches the hole’s edge must make an <i>avoidance</i>
saving throw or fall in. Tunnels that are dug
just below the surface of the earth are noted by the
raised mound/roof caused by the displacement of earth
(not unlike the mound of an ant hole).</p>"
