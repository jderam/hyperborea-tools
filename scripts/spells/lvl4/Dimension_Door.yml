Desc: "<p>The caster or one other creature is transported to a
specified location within 360 feet. If the caster is unaware
of the destination, a distance and direction (e.g.,
“50 feet south”) may be designated; however, if the
destination is not a safe place on which the transported
creature would have firm footing, or if the destination
is solid material (such as a wall or tree), then the spell
will fail to function. An unwilling target is allowed a
<i>sorcery</i> saving throw to negate the spell’s effects.</p>"
