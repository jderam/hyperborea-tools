Desc: "<p>The sorcerer casts this subtle spell by pinching 1 gp
worth of gold dust betwixt the thumb and forefinger;
this may be done behind the back or within the folds
of his or her robes. (The casting likely goes unnoticed
by those who are present.) Once the spell is cast, the
sorcerer can detect whether those within range speak
truthfully or not. The detection is perceived in degrees:
Horrible lies produce magnified discernment, whilst
simple exaggerations give off faint signals.</p>
<p>The reverse of this spell, <i>indiscernible lie</i>, not only
counters the effects of <i>discern lie</i>, but also allows the
caster or other willing subject to stretch the truth or
even tell bald-faced lies that sound reasonable to any
within range who fail a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified
by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.</p>"
