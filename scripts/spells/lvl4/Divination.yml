Desc: "<p>Upon 1 turn of prayer and cogitation, the sorcerer
implores the wisdom of otherworldly powers. The
focus of the divination is an area: a small woodland
(not exceeding 1 square mile), a large building or
tower, a section of a dungeon, the top of a mountain,
or the like. Note that this spell cannot be used to ask
direct questions of a yes or no nature; such enquiries
are covered by the <i>commune</i> spell. Here follow some
suggestions of what may be divined:</p>
<ul><li>The relative weakness or
strength of potential enemies</li>
<li>The potential amount of treasure
to be won within (scant, moderate, rich)</li>
<li>The chance of being confronted by
enemies if the area in question is intruded</li>
<li>The presence of a d√¶mon or otherworldly being</li>
<li>The presence of potent sorcery at work</li></ul>
<p>After the player states what his or her character attempts
to divine, the referee must make a secret d10
roll. The sorcerer has a 7-in-10 chance of successfully
divining the sought-after information (if the request
is reasonable). If the reading is successful, the referee
will inform the player of the result, providing
valuable, albeit general, information. If the reading is
unsuccessful, false or misleading information may be
revealed. Casting this spell might entail consequences:
The otherworldly power invoked might charge the sorcerer
with a <i>quest</i> (q.v.).</p>"
