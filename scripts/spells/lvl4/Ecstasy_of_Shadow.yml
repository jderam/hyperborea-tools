Desc: "<p>A 20 Ã— 20-foot rippling shadow emerges within 10 feet
of the caster, floating at 20 MV in any direction chosen
until concentration ceases or the duration is met. Any
intelligent or quasi-intelligent creature of 2 HD or fewer
in the shadowed area directly falls to the ground in
spasms of necrophiliac ecstasy with lifeless shadow beings
for 2d6 rounds. Victims are unable to take any other
actions (effectively <i>prone</i>). Creatures of 3 HD or more
must make <i>sorcery</i> saving throws (modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>) or fall into a similar state for 1d6 rounds.
The sorcerer can affect 3 HD of creatures per CA level.
This spell can bring great shame and dishonour to paladins
and cataphracts who comport themselves to a code
of gentility; <i>atonement</i> may be required.</p>"
