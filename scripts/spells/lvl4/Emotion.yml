Desc: "<p>Elicits an irrational response from all human and quasi-
man victims in a 30-foot-diameter area unless they
make <i>sorcery</i> saving throws, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. (No save is necessary if the
subjects are willing.) <i>Emotion</i> has three applications,
one of which is selected by the sorcerer at the time of
casting:</p>
<ul><li><i>Despair:</i> A feeling of hopelessness and gloom.
The affected will turn back, surrender, and
submit to the demands of the sorcerer, so long
as said demands are not completely contrary to
their nature.</li>
<li><i>Fear:</i> Complete fear, in which the affected panic
and flee; however, if fleeing is not possible, they
will cower and grovel. Saving throws for this
variation are made at −2 penalties.</li>
<li><i>Furious Hatred:</i> Targets become subject to
battle lust. Attacks are made at +1 on attack
rolls and +3 damage, but with a −4 AC penalty.
Recipients of this effect refuse to surrender and
continue to fight no matter the cost. (Does not
stack with a berserker’s <i>berserk rage</i>.)</li></ul>
<p>This spell persists for its maximum duration, but the
sorcerer must concentrate throughout (standing still,
no other actions taken), or the spell will terminate immediately.</p>"
