Desc: "<p>From outstretched hands, the sorcerer releases a black
bolt of negative energy called forth from the impossible
depths of the Black Gulf. The target must make a
<i>sorcery</i> saving throw or suffer a temporary draining
of energy and vitality. The victim loses 2d8 hp and suffers
penalties of −2 “to hit,” −2 damage, and −2 AC.
Lastly, the victim is beset by a stiffness of the limbs not
unlike rigour mortis, preventing movement any faster
than normal walking speed (no running or charging).</p>"
