Desc: "<p>From the nether reaches of the Black Gulf is conjured
a phantom watchdog seen only by the caster. The
creature can be commanded to guard a door, gate, hall,
room, or the like. The sorcerer cannot move more than
30 feet from the location of the <i>faithful hound</i> or the
spell will be broken.</p>
<p>The <i>faithful hound</i> immediately begins to bark and
howl when anything larger than a rat approaches.
The <i>hound</i> can detect invisible, inaudible, and even
extra-dimensional creatures, so it makes for an astonishingly
perspicacious guardian. If an intruder turns
its back on the <i>faithful hound</i>, the watchdog will make
a single bite attack as an FA 10 creature, inflicting
3d6 hp damage. The <i>hound</i> itself cannot be attacked,
though it can be destroyed via the <i>dispel magic</i> spell.</p>"
