Desc: "<p>Creates a potent illusion that causes an area to appear
empty, unoccupied, and/or neglected. The affected area
can be 10 feet in diameter per CA level. <i>False vacancy</i> is
a combination of <i>invisibility</i> and <i>phantasm</i>, but it cannot
mask living creatures. The details of <i>false vacancy</i>
are up to the sorcerer. Observers might, for example,
see a treasure room as a dusty, cobweb-filled chamber
containing a few broken pieces of furniture. If a group
passes through the dweomered area, the illusion will
adapt to their passage: Cobwebs will float, dusty footprints
will be left in their wake, and so forth. Unless a
masked object is touched by an investigating creature,
the area will seem empty of what it actually contains.</p>
<p>If the real contents of the masked area are forcibly
shaken or handled roughly, the creature doing so may
make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. If successful, the illusion will
begin to shimmer, and the invisible object is revealed. If
the saving throw fails, the subject believes that contact
was made with an invisible object. Note that casual and
careful touching of masked objects is not cause for a saving
throw because the illusion cannot be disrupted unless
handled with force. <i>Dispel phantasm</i> can break this
spell, revealing that which is concealed by the illusion,
but <i>dispel magic</i> and <i>detect invisibility</i> are ineffective.</p>"
