Desc: "<p>Blue-green wisps of flame radiate from the casterâ€™s
body, emitting 15 feet of light. The sorcerer is thus
protected against cold-based spells/effects and gains a
+2 saving throw bonus versus such attacks, sustaining
no damage if the save is made and no more than
half damage if the save fails. Alternatively, violet-blue
flames radiate from the caster, protecting the sorcerer
from fire-based attacks instead (+2 saves, no damage
if save is made, half damage if save fails). No matter
which variation is cast, melee attacks that strike the
caster cause the assailant twice as many hit points of
damage as inflicted in the form of a fiery backlash.</p>"
