Desc: "<p>Causes ambulatory plants (natural and supernatural)
to cease movement and freeze; likewise, it prevents
enchanted plants from entangling, and it prevents flora
from being moved by other forces, such as wind or
rain. As much as 40 × 40 feet of vegetation can be so
<i>held</i>. <i>Hold vegetation</i> also affects plant-like monsters,
such as <b>violet fungi</b>, <b>green slimes</b>, <b>mustard moulds</b>,
<b>shambling mounds</b>, and <b>tree-men</b>. It can be cast at a
single plant monster or a group of monsters, so long as
they are within a 20-foot radius of the spell’s primary
target. When cast at a group, as many as four plant
monsters may be affected, beginning with those closest
to the primary target. Each target is allowed a <i>sorcery</i>
saving throw to resist the spell; if but a single target is
selected, its saving throw is made at a −2 penalty.</p>"
