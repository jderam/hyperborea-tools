Desc: "<p>Fist-sized hailstones pound down with great force,
causing 3d10 hp damage to all within the 30 × 30-foot
area of effect, no saving throws allowed. The damage is
the result of blunt force, not cold, so spells such as <i>cold
resistance</i> offer no defence. Alternatively, the sorcerer
can use this spell to create a 90 × 90-foot area of driving
sleet that effectively snow-blinds its victims and
halves their movement. Any attempt to run through
such an area is subject to an <i>avoidance</i> saving throw,
or the subject will slip and fall.</p>"
