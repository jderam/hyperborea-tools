Desc: "<p>An <i>igloo</i> is evoked, surrounding the caster and providing
suitable shelter for as many as six companions.
It is 15 feet in base diameter, with walls that arch to an
apex 7½ feet high. It has a snowy white exterior, but
from the inside the walls appear transparent, allowing
its inhabitants to see the outdoors with perfect clarity.
A lambent light emanates from the interior ceiling
upon the will of the caster. The interior temperature is
cool but comfortable. The <i>igloo</i> can withstand heavy
winds, rain, sleet, hail, snow, and temperatures as high
as 90℉ before slowly beginning to melt. If struck, the
<i>igloo</i> can sustain 36 hp damage before it is destroyed.
Whilst the caster’s companions are free to enter and
exit, once the caster leaves, the <i>igloo</i> will crumble.</p>"
