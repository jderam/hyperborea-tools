Desc: "<p>This spell requires a sacrifice of gold or gems valued
at 300 gp or more. The sorcerer creates an illusion of
a wall, floor, ceiling, or another surface. The <i>illusory
wall</i> can be as large as 1 × 10 × 10 feet and is convincingly
realistic. The surface can be made to look as
though it were of brick, stone, wood, or like material.
An <i>illusory wall</i> might be used to create the appearance
of a dead end, or perhaps to cover a pit, in which
case only careful searching will reveal the deception.
The surface can be passed through, but such transit
will not terminate it. The spell is permanent unless
<i>dispel phantasm</i> is cast.</p>"
