Desc: "<p>The sorcerer imprints into the mind of a willing subject
as many as three memorized spells. The recipient must
have a minimum wisdom score of 9, or the spell will fail.
The recipient will then be able to cast these spells at a
time of their choosing, just as the sorcerer would. Like
the sorcerer’s memorization, the conferred spells remain
burnt in the recipient’s mind until they are cast.</p>
<p>No more than two level 1 spells and one level 2 spell
can be conferred. Once a recipient is thus <i>imbued</i>, the
sorcerer cannot rememorize a transferred spell level
until the recipient casts the spell. So, if a sorcerer
grants a <i>cure light wounds</i> spell to an ally, then the
sorcerer can rememorize one fewer level 1 spell until
the ally casts that spell. Of course, the sorcerer cannot
confer more spells than he or she can memorize.</p>"
