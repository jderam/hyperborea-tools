Desc: "<p>Functions as the <i>invisibility</i> spell (q.v.), except that its
recipient (human, humanoid, or giant) can attack or
cast harmful spells at enemies without reappearing in
exchange for a more limited spell duration. The invisible
personâ€™s attacks, however, cause a slight shimmer
or vibration in the air around them, allowing enemies
to distinguish their approximate whereabouts; hence
enemies can counterattack, though the invisible person
enjoys a +4 AC bonus.</p>"
