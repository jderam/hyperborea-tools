Desc: "<p>When cast by a cleric or necromancer, this evil curse
brings insanity to its victim (human or humanoid).
When cast by an illusionist, the spell effects a phantasmal
nightmare that produces madness. In either case,
the target must make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw or suffer
a random form of <i>madness</i> (consult your referee for
specific results). The saving throw is modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. A <i>remove curse</i> spell
ends the madness if the spell was cast by a cleric or
necromancer; <i>dispel phantasm</i> can exorcize madness
caused by illusionists (cf. <i>cure madness</i>).</p>"
