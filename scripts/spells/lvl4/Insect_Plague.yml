Desc: "<p>The sorcerer summons a vast swarm of flying insects
(usually a combination of bees, beetles, cicadas, locusts,
and mosquitoes) 30 feet high and 60 feet in diameter. Vision
is reduced to 10 feet for those victims caught within
the swarm, and the shrill droning of the cicadas is maddening
and disorienting. For every round spent within
the swarm, victims sustain 1 hp damage from stings
and bites. Animals or monsters of 2 HD or less almost
always will be driven away in panic. Heavy smoke or a
roaring fire drives away the <i>insect plague</i>; otherwise,
it remains stationary until the spellâ€™s duration elapses.</p>"
