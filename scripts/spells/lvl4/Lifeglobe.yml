Desc: "<p>The caster speaks an incantation whilst tossing a piece
of freshly picked green vegetation into the air. The
vegetation immediately transforms into a 10-inch-diameter,
glowing green sphere that hovers no more
than 10 feet away from the caster. Until the sphere dissipates,
any living creature touching it—friend and foe
alike—will gain one of the following benefits (chosen
by the one touching the sphere):</p>
<ul><li>Heal 1 hit die (roll HD type) modified by constitution
<i>hit point adjustment</i> (if applicable)</li>
<li>Recover from one physical ailment (e.g., blindness,
deafness, disease), though not poison</li>
<li>Gain 1d4 days of nourishment and hydration</li></ul>
<p>Note that each recipient may derive
the benefits of the <i>lifeglobe</i>
but once from the same casting.
The lifeglobe can be destroyed if
struck. It may be considered AC 6
and is allowed an item saving throw
(as <i>wood, thin</i>).</p>"
