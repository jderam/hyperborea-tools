related to normal electricity for one hour per CA level.
If cast on oneself, the sorcerer gains immunity from a
single magical lightning/electricity attack (e.g., <i>lightning
bolt</i>, <i>shocking grasp</i>, a <b>behirâ€™s</b> breath) before the
spell is broken. A recipient of this spell other than the
sorcerer simply gains a +4 saving throw bonus versus
a single magical lightning/electricity attack before the
