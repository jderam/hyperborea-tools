Desc: "<p>As many as 100 willing humans or humanoids can be concealed
by this spell. The recipients appear as trees (i.e., a
small orchard or grove) so long as they remain still. Creatures
can move through and even touch the “trees” without
being aware of their true form; however, if a “tree” is
attacked, it will bleed. If any recipient of this spell moves,
he or she will reappear as normal; if the caster moves, the
spell is broken. <i>True seeing</i> reveals the “trees” for what
they are, and <i>dispel magic</i> cancels the spell.</p>"
