Desc: "<p>Effects the creation of an object no denser than hardwood
(ash, beech, oak, etc.); stone and metal objects
are unachievable. The object can be no greater than
one cubic foot in size per CA level. To create the item,
the sorcerer must have some piece of the material to be
produced: If generating a 50-foot hemp rope, a small
thread of hemp must be held; if the sorcerer wishes to
create a small raft of beech, a splinter of beech wood is
required. The item disappears when the spell ends, as
will the component.</p>"
