Desc: "<p>Enchants a polished silver mirror to become a temporary
scrying device. The sorcerer may then view a
known subject (human or monster) over any distance,
so long as both are on the same plane of existence. The
extent of familiarity dictates the probability of success:</p>
<p><table><caption><b>Table 106: Mirror, Mirror Spell</b></caption>
<tr><th style=text-align:left>Familiarity</th><th>Chance of Locating</th></tr>
<tr><td style=text-align:left>Very familiar</td><td>5:6</td></tr>
<tr><td style=text-align:left>Somewhat familiar</td><td>4:6</td></tr>
<tr><td style=text-align:left>Seen in a picture or sketch</td><td>3:6</td></tr>
<tr><td style=text-align:left>Item or garment in possession</td><td>2:6</td></tr>
<tr><td style=text-align:left>Described by another person</td><td>1:6</td></tr></table></p>
<p>The subject can be observed for the duration of the
spell, which will also depict anyone or anything within
30 feet; if the subject is in complete darkness, the caster
will see only vague details. Creatures with intelligence
of 13 or higher have a 1-in-6 chance of cognizing they
are being watched by means sorcerous. Too, if <i>mirror,
mirror</i> is used to view one who is 10 HD or greater, the
subject may make a <i>sorcery</i> save to cognize the effect;
otherwise, he or she remains ignorant.</p>"
