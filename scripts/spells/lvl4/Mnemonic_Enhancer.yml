Desc: "<p>Casting this ritual requires 1 turn and the sacrifice of a
gem of 100-gp value or greater. Once cast, the sorcerer
can memorize or rememorize additional spell levels,
selecting one of the following four allotments:</p>
<ul><li>Four level 1 spells</li>
<li>Two level 1 spells, one level 2 spell</li>
<li>Two level 2 spells</li>
<li>One level 1 spell, one level 3 spell</li></ul>
<p>If the memorize option is cast, the additional spells
are at the sorcererâ€™s disposal for a 24-hour period, after
which they fade from memory. If the rememorize
option is cast, the sorcerer recalls spells already cast
that day. The rememorized spells must be cast within
24 hours or they will fade from memory.</p>"
