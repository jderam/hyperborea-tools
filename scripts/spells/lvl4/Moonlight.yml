Desc: "<p>Illumes a 25-foot-diameter area with a moonbeam, the
luminosity of which rivals that of a full moon; the effect is
not unlike a spotlight. Soft light extends in a 25-foot radius
beyond the spellâ€™s area, so the entire effect (75-foot
diameter in total) appears quite natural (when outdoors,
of course). This spell does not interfere with <i>infrared
vision</i>, though it can enhance <i>ultraviolet vision</i>.</p>"
