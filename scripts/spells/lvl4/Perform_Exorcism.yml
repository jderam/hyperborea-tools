Desc: "<p>By means of this potent ritual, which requires 6d10
turns to complete, the sorcerer exorcizes a dæmon or
another supernatural force from possession of a person
or object. This spell can negate dæmonic possession, a
<i>magic jar</i> spell, or any of the enchantments or charms
that compel one to behave as they otherwise would not,
such as <i>charm person</i> and <i>suggestion</i>. If a possessed
person is the subject of this spell, the exorcized dæmon
or force is banished to the netherworld whence it came.</p>
<p>If a possessed object is the subject of this spell, the
possessing dæmon or force is not necessarily banished;
it will attempt to possess a nearby creature (possibly
the caster of this spell). The referee must randomly
determine whom the dæmon or force will seek. It may
be one that the dæmon feels it can conquer easily, one
of little willpower, such as a child, or a person weak of
body and mind. The potential victim is granted a <i>sorcery</i>
saving throw, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>,
if applicable, or they suffer the effects of possession.
The victim may be unaware of the possession until
such subtle signs as uncharacteristic behaviour and
memory loss present.</p>"
