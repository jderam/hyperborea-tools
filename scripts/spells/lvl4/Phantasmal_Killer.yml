Desc: "<p>This cerebral phantasm preys on the most horrific
fears of its victims, who must be of animal intelligence
or greater. A nightmarish beast is seen only by the
sorcerer and the target. The beast attacks as an FA 4
creature. If it hits, the victim is allowed a <i>death</i> saving
throw, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.
The target’s saving throw might also be modified
by any of the following conditions:</p>
<ul><li><i>Surprize:</i> If the target is surprized, a −2 penalty
on the saving throw.</li>
<li><i>Target Has Previous Experience:</i> If the target
has been subject to the wiles of such an illusion
before, +2 bonus to the saving throw.</li>
<li><i>Target is an Illusionist:</i> If the target is an
illusionist, +2 bonus to the saving throw, in
addition to the <i>perceive illusion</i> ability unique to
that class.</li></ul>
<p>If the saving throw fails, the victim is slain by the <i>phantasmal
killer</i>. If the saving throw is successful, the
target has disbelieved the phantasm, and a backlash
effect strikes the caster unconscious for 1d10 rounds,
unless a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw is made, modified by
<i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.</p>"
