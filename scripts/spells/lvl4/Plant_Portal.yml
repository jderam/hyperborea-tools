Desc: "<p>Opens a magical passageway in trees, vines, or thick
underbrush, no matter how impenetrable they appear.
Even enchanted <i>plant growth</i> is affected by this spell.
The portal is as large as 3 feet wide, 7 feet high, and
100 feet long, and it remains open for 1 turn. After this
spell is cast, those companions who are touched by the
sorcerer (one per CA level) can pass through as well,
though they must stay behind the caster.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the sorcerer alone can use this spell
enter a tree and remain within it for no longer than
9 turns, hiding within the trunk and observing what
transpires without. If the sorcerer does not exit the
tree before the spell’s termination, a successful <i>transformation</i>
saving throw must be rolled or the sorcerer
is forever trapped; if the save succeeds the sorcerer
is ejected. <i>Detect magic</i> will not reveal the sorcerer’s
presence in the tree, but the <i>true seeing</i> spell will.</p>"
