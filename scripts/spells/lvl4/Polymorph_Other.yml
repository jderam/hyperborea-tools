Desc: "<p>Transmogrifies one creature into another type of creature
(though not a specific individual) unless a <i>transformation</i>
saving throw is made. Unlike <i>polymorph self</i>,
the affected creature becomes the new form in all ways,
including all attacks and special abilities. The victim also
assumes the behaviour and tendencies of the new form.
For example, a person turned into an ass will think and
behave as an ass; his personality will be buried. Note
that the victim cannot be transformed into any creature
more than 5 HD greater than the original form; also,
the former hit point total remains the same, so a 22-hp
fighter transformed into a toad becomes a 22-hp toad.
This spell is broken only if the victim dies, or if <i>dispel
magic</i> is cast; in the latter case, the victim must make
a <i>trauma survival</i> check to survive the transformation
(see <b>Chapter 3: Statistics</b>, <i>constitution</i>); otherwise,
their innards are turned inside out.</p>"
