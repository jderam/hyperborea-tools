Desc: "<p>The sorcerer transforms into any living creature of
equal or lesser HD (though not a specific individual),
from as small as a mouse to as large as a mammoth, so
long as the caster is familiar with the desired shape.
Upon transforming, the caster retains armour class,
hit points, fighting ability, and saving throws. All possessions
are melded with the new form, and the caster
no longer realizes the benefits of any magical items,
except for magical rings.</p>
<p>The sorcerer acquires the natural physical abilities of
the new form (e.g., a bear’s claw/claw/bite attacks, a
falcon’s flight, a shark’s undersea breathing), but not
special attacks (e.g., a snake’s venom, an eel’s electric
shock) or defences (e.g., a dæmon’s <i>sorcery resistance</i>,
a lycanthrope’s immunity to normal weapons). Unlike
<i>polymorph other</i> victims, the caster retains his or her
mental capacity, though is unable to speak as normal
or cast other spells if the form is not humanoid. The
sorcerer can terminate the spell at will without need
of a <i>trauma survival</i> check; when the spell ends, the
caster heals 2d6 hp of damage sustained (if applicable).
If killed whilst <i>polymorphed</i>, the sorcerer’s true form
will be revealed.</p>"
