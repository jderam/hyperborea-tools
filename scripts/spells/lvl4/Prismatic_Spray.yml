Desc: "<p>From the illusionist’s outstretched fingertips springs
a twisting, fan-shaped array of all seven colours of the
visible spectrum, forming a wedge 5 feet wide at its
base, 50 feet long, and 20 feet wide at its terminus. Any
creature within the area of effect will be struck by one
or more of these rays; roll a d8 to determine which:</p>
<p><table><caption><b>Table 108: Prismatic Spray Effects</b></caption>
<tr><th>d8 Result</th><th>Prismatic Spray Effect</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Red ray inflicts 2 hp of burning damage per
CA level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Orange ray that inflicts 3 hp of burning
damage per CA level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yellow ray that permanently blinds the
target unless a <i>sorcery</i> save is made; blind
creatures always lose initiative and suffer
−4 “to hit,” −4 AC, and −4 saving throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Green ray that poisons the victim; <i>death</i>
(poison) saving throw or immediate death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Blue ray that paralyzes the victim for 3d4
turns unless a <i>death</i> saving throw is made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Indigo ray causes the target to suffer intense
hallucinations for 1d6 turns per the
<i>madness</i> rules (see <b>Table 148</b>) unless a
<i>sorcery</i> save is made, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Violet ray <i>stuns</i> the target for 3d4 rounds;
<i>sorcery</i> saving throw negates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Struck by two rays; roll twice, ignoring results
of 8.</td></tr></table></p>"
