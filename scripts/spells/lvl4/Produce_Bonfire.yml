Desc: "<p>Causes a fire to ignite magically, a full, roaring blaze
as large as 12 feet in diameter. If cast upon an appropriate
pile of wood, the bonfire can persist for one day
per CA level; if made to spring from thin air, it lasts but
1 turn per CA level. Creatures in the area of effect suffer
1d4 hp damage unless they make an <i>avoidance</i> saving
throw. Any combustibles worn by the victims (e.g.,
cotton, linen, wool) might be damaged or destroyed by
the <i>produce bonfire</i> spell; certainly, paper and parchment
stand no chance of survival. The reverse of this
spell, <i>quench bonfire</i>, extinguishes any normal fire
within the spellâ€™s range and area of effect.</p>"
