Desc: "<p>The sorcererâ€™s weird gesticulations evoke a pattern of
rainbow-hued, interweaving colours in a 30-foot-diameter
area. The sorcerer can direct the <i>rainbow pattern</i>
to travel at 30 MV to the limit of its range. The spell
affects no more than 24 HD of seeing creatures; i.e., it
does not affect blind or sightless creatures. Those who
fail their <i>sorcery</i> saving throws, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable, doltishly follow the interplaying
colours. If the <i>rainbow pattern</i> leads its victims
off a cliff or another hazard, each victim is allowed
a second save to resist effecting their potential demise.
The spell lasts for as long as the caster continues to
gesticulate, plus 1d4 rounds thereafter.</p>"
