Desc: "<p>A shimmering globe of force encapsulates the subject
of this spell, which must be of Small or Medium size.
The subject must make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw or be
trapped within the confines of the <i>resilient sphere</i> until
the spellâ€™s duration elapses. Inside the <i>sphere</i>, the air
is breathable. If the subject struggles for freedom, the
only result will be a slight movement of the <i>sphere</i>; in
fact, those who are outside the <i>sphere</i> may roll it, should
they so choose. The <i>sphere</i> is immune to physical harm,
but can be negated by a <i>dispel magic</i> spell, a <i>disintegrate</i>
spell, or magic items that produce similar results.</p>"
