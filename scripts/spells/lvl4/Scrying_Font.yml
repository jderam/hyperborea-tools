Desc: "<p>Enchants a font (e.g., a basin or bowl) that contains
no less than 24 ounces of holy water to become a temporary
scrying device. The sorcerer may then view a
known subject (human or monster) over any distance,
so long as both are on the same plane of existence. The
extent of familiarity dictates the probability of success:</p>
<p><table><caption><b>Table 111: Scrying Font Spell</b></caption>
<tr><th>Familiarity</th><th>Chance of Locating</th></tr>
<tr><td>Very familiar</td><td>5:6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Somewhat familiar</td><td>4:6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Seen in a picture or sketch</td><td>3:6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Item or garment in possession</td><td>2:6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Described by another person</td><td>1:6</td></tr></table></p>
<p>The subject can be observed for the duration of the
spell, including anything or anyone within 30 feet; if
the subject is in complete darkness, the caster will see
only vague details. Creatures with intelligence of 13
or higher have a 1-in-6 chance of cognizing they are
being watched by means sorcerous. Too, if <i>scrying
font</i> is used to view one who is 10 HD or greater, the
subject may make a <i>sorcery</i> save to cognize the effect;
otherwise, the spell is undetected. The holy water will
evaporate as the spell’s duration elapses until naught
remains at the spell’s conclusion.</p>"
