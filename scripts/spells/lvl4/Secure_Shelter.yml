Desc: "<p>The sorcerer conducts a 6-turn (1-hour) ritual that
requires the sacrifice of 500 gp in gold or gems.
A hut or lodge is then conjured from materials natural
to the area where the spell is cast (e.g., sod, stones,
timbers, wattle and daub). The material rises to form a
single-storey shelter with floor space of 30 × 30 feet. It
may be fashioned to have windows, a door, a chimney,
and other simple features—even a table, chairs, and
bunk beds, if so desired. The <i>secure shelter</i> enjoys other
enchantments as well:</p>
<p><ul><li>Impervious to normal fire and normal missiles
(arrows and quarrels)</li>
<li>Can withstand winds not exceeding 75 mph</li>
<li>Door(s) has a <i>sorcerer lock</i> (q.v.)</li>
<li>Each door and window is <i>alarmed</i> (q.v.)</li>
<li>Contains an <i>unseen servant</i> (q.v.) that maintains
cleanliness and assists with cooking, stoking the
fire, etc.</li></ul></p>"
