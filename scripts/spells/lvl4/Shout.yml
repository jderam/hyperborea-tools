Desc: "<p>Endows the sorcerer with astonishing vocal power that
releases in an ear-splitting sonic cone. The cone is 30
feet long and 10 feet wide at its terminus. Those who
are within the area of effect must make <i>sorcery</i> saving
throws or suffer 3d6 hp damage; victims are also
deafened for a like number of rounds. A deaf creature
is surprized on a base 4-in-6 chance and suffers an individual
initiative penalty of −2 (i.e., the deaf creature
may lose initiative, despite its allies winning). Targets
that make their saves sustain half damage and do not
suffer deafness. Brittle objects, including glass and
clay, might be shattered by the sonic blast. Even a <i>wall
of ice</i> spell can be exploded by this spell. <i>Shout</i> can be
used no more than once per day, or the caster’s vocal
cords are damaged (no voice beyond a grating whisper;
no spells can be cast) for 2d4 weeks.</p>"
