Desc: "<p>The sorcerer radiates a personal aura of <i>fear</i> in a
three-foot radius upon uttering this spell, manifesting
as a ghostly, nearly imperceptible death shroud. Any
creature (friend or foe) that intrudes on this space
must make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable, or run away in terror
for 6 rounds (1 minute). This spell has no effect against
the undead or mindless constructs.</p>"
