Desc: "<p>Creates a cloud as large as 10 feet thick, 30 feet long,
and 30 feet high. Only a gale-force wind (35 mph or
greater) disperses this spell; even a <i>gust of wind</i> spell
is insufficient. Any creature within or attempting to
traverse the <i>solid fog</i> is slowed by the fogâ€™s density
to a maximum rate of 10 MV. Normal sight cannot
penetrate <i>solid fog</i>, and <i>infrared vision</i> is unavailing.
Potent fire spells such as <i>fireball</i>, <i>flame strike</i>, or <i>wall
of fire</i> burn away <i>solid fog</i> in 1 round.</p>"
