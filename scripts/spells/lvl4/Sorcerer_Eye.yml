Desc: "<p>An invisible oculus is conjured and sent forth to “see”
for the sorcerer, providing visual sensory information.
The <i>sorcerer eye</i> drifts at 30 MV and can see 60 feet
ahead of itself if light is present; lacking illuminance,
the <i>eye</i> sees with <i>infrared vision</i> to a range of 30 feet
and can float in any direction as dictated by the sorcerer,
who must sit cross-legged with eyes closed, concentrating.
The spell ends when the sorcerer’s eyes open,
or when the duration expires.</p>"
