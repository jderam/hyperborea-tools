Desc: "<p>Establish rudimentary communication with vegetal
life that surrounds the sorcerer in a 30-foot radius.
Casting this spell requires 1 turn of meditation. Once
complete, the caster can ask a simple question, such as
whether a creature passed through the area of effect.
The reply is via an empathic feeling conveyed by the
plants. The caster may also assert a modicum of control
over the area of effect, asking grasses or shrubs
to part, even beseeching vines or hanging branches to
hinder the progress of a pursuer. This effect should
not be confused with the <i>entangle spell</i>, however; the
plants are simply nudged to a limited course of action.</p>"
