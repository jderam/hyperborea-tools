Desc: "<p>A snowy blast of arctic wind blows from the caster
(in the direction faced) in a path that is always 10 feet
wide but with variable length depending on the caster:
5 feet of length may be added for each CA level the
sorcerer possesses; e.g., a CA 7 sorcerer can evoke
a <i>squall</i> that is 10 feet wide by 35 feet long. <i>Squall</i>
temporarily blinds victims in its path for 1d4 rounds.
Blinded creatures automatically lose initiative and
suffer âˆ’4 penalties on attack rolls, armour class, and
saving throws. <i>Squall</i> extinguishes natural bonfires
and can even snuff a <i>wall of fire</i>; too, it disperses and
thus negates magical clouds, fogs, and smoke, such as
<i>cloudkill</i>, <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>solid fog</i>, and <i>stinking cloud</i>.</p>"
