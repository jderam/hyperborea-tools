Desc: "<p>By sacrificing a diamond of 500-gp value or greater, the
sorcerer imbues oneself or another with flesh as hard
as diamond. For every CA level of the sorcerer, the
recipient gains immunity to one physical attack (melee
or missile), even from a magical weapon. The recipient
does not, however, gain immunity to spells or other sorcerous
effects; e.g., a <i>magic missile</i> spell causes normal
damage and does not count as a “hit” against the spell’s
duration—only the <i>magic stone</i> spell is effective in this
latter regard. The sorcerer cannot place this spell on
more than one recipient at a time; any attempt to do so
results in the sorcerer suffering petrifaction (no save).</p>"
