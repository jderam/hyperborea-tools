Desc: "<p>Sorcery transports a <b>lesser dæmon</b> from Underborea
as selected by the sorcerer, depending on need. The
dæmon will arrive 1 round after the spell is cast and
will perform its designated task, after which, dead or
alive, it will either disappear or turn on the caster and/
or any allies (see below). When casting this spell, the
sorcerer must explicitly state the <i>summoned</i> type:
“defender,” “illuminator,” or “seeker.”</p>
<p><ul><li><b>Defender</b>: <i>Summons</i> a random dæmon to
assault the sorcerer’s enemies as directed for
no longer than 6 rounds. The target(s) must be
pointed out straight away, or else the dæmon
will attack the sorcerer and/or any allies. If the
stated target(s) is defeated, the standard chance
of betrayal applies.

* A witch may summon this dæmon for the purpose of an
unspeakable union.</p></li>
<li><b>Illuminator</b>: <i>Summons</i> a single <b>class ix lesser
dæmon</b>. The beast will use its special <b>legend
lore</b> ability to determine the whereabouts of
a subterranean artefact, of which it will then
inform the caster and spend no more than 1
turn attempting to locate. If the artefact does
not exist or is not underground, the beast will
attack the sorcerer and/or any comrades. Even
if the treasure location is revealed successfully,
this dæmon will demand a blood sacrifice before
returning to Underborea; if the sacrifice is
deemed unsuitable (at the referee’s discretion),
the dæmon will attack. Regardless, even after
such a sacrifice is accepted, the standard chance
of betrayal applies.</li>
<li><b>Seeker</b>: <i>Summons</i> a single <b>class x lesser
dæmon</b> to search and destroy. When the <i>seeker</i>
type is designated, the sorcerer also must
describe the prey (name, species, and so forth).
The dæmon then will track its quarry until it
is found and killed, after which the standard
chance of betrayal applies. If no trail is found
within 6 rounds, the dæmon will attack the
sorcerer and/or any allies. If called upon to face
an enemy that it cannot hunt, it likewise will
turn on the sorcerer.</li></ul></p>
<p><i>Betrayal:</i> Dæmons are infamous for betrayal. Upon
completing their prescribed task, they may turn on the
sorcerer and/or any allies on a 1-in-6 chance. Dæmons
are, however, subject to morale checks during the
entire <i>summon dæmon</i> process. Those that fail will
attempt to flee (if possible), now permanent inhabitants
of Hyperborea that may one day seek revenge.
Wise sorcerers are known to take sanctuary within the
confines of a candlelit magic circle whilst casting and
maintaining this spell; of course, the magic circle will
only protect the sorcerer, not allies.</p>"
