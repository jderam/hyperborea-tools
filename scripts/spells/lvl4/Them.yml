Desc: "<p>Transforms one or more ants into <b>giant radioactive
ants</b> that at once begin to issue a loud, warbling whistle.
The number depends on the sorcerer’s casting ability:
2 ants at CA 7, 3 ants at CA 9, and 4 ants at CA 11.
The giant ants can act 1 round after transformation.
They will not harm the caster and will obey simple
commands such as “Attack!”, “Defend!”, “Lift!”, and so
forth. If the giant ants are not otherwise instructed,
they will attack the nearest creature (not differentiating
between and betwixt allies and enemies).</p>"
