Desc: "<p>A spell that can <i>transfer wounds</i> from a willing subject
to another willing recipient, which may be the spell
caster. A maximum of 20 hp damage can be <i>transferred</i>.
The process involves a 1-turn ritual in which
the wounds, by way of hands firmly grasped, pass
from the subject to the recipient. If a recipient other
than the sorcerer is involved, both must be touched by
the caster. The one who absorbs the damage may be
drained to no lower than 0 hp; e.g., someone with 16 hp
can absorb 1â€“16 hp of damage from the subject.</p>"
