Desc: "<p>Through incantations the sorcerer transforms sticks
into snakes, in numbers not exceeding the caster’s CA
level, if sufficient sticks are within range. Each stick becomes
a three-foot <b>viper</b> that obeys the sorcerer’s will.
The reverse of this spell, <i>turn serpents to sticks</i>, transforms
a snake or snakes into sticks. As many HD worth
of snakes can be affected as the sorcerer has CA levels.</p>"
