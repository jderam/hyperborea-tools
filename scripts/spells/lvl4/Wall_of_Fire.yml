Desc: "<p>Evokes an opaque, shimmering barrier of violet-red
flames to spring from the ground. The <i>wall of fire</i> can
be as large as 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a circle
of flames 30 feet in diameter and 20 feet high; both
variations are six inches thick. The sorcerer can adjust
the size if so desired, but not the shape. The spell
persists for as long as the sorcerer concentrates, plus
1 round per CA level thereafter.</p>
<p>Creatures 3 HD and fewer cannot pass through the
<i>wall of fire</i>; they are repelled. Creatures of 4 HD or
greater can pass through, but they sustain 3d6 hp
damage, +1 hp per CA level (so a CA 9 sorcererâ€™s <i>wall
of fire</i> inflicts 3d6+9 hp damage). Undead suffer two
extra damage dice: 5d6 hp, +1 hp per CA level.</p>"
