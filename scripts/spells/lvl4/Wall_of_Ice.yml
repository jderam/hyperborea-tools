Desc: "<p>Evokes an opaque, blue-white, rimy barricade to spring
from the ground. The <i>wall of ice</i> can be as large as 60
feet long and 20 feet high, or a circle 30 feet in diameter
and 20 feet high; both variations are six inches thick.
The sorcerer can adjust the size if so desired, but not the
shape. The <i>wall</i> negates most spells and powers related
to fire, unless the magical fire wielder is of greater CA
(or HD) than the sorcerer who conjured the <i>wall of ice</i>.</p>
<p><i>Wall of ice</i> repels all creatures of 3 HD or fewer. Creatures
of 4 HD or greater can attempt to break through
with <i>extraordinary feats of strength</i>; this endeavour
requires 1d6 turns and assumes the use of heavy hammers,
axes, picks, or the like. (For many monsters, the
referee will need to assign a reasonable strength score
based on the creatureâ€™s HD, size, and mass.) Most
unintelligent creatures will see the <i>wall</i> as an impenetrable
barrier and will not consider breaking through
it. Smashing through causes 2d6 hp damage for most
creatures (due to collapsing ice); creatures of or related
to heat or fire suffer 3d6 hp damage.</p>"
