Desc: "<p>Evokes an invisible barrier to form around the caster
in a 10-foot radius, repelling all normal insect life. Giant
insects are allowed <i>sorcery</i> saving throws. Successful
saves allow the creatures to behave as normal, though
they suffer 1d6 hp damage for entering the field; failed
saves cause the insects to flee in fear. This spell does
not affect spiders and centipedes.</p>"
