Desc: "<p>To <i>hypnotize</i> a single target. To resist, the target is
granted a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. Hostile or aggressive creatures
gain +1 to +3 bonuses on their saves, as judged by
the referee. A failed save indicates the victim is unaware
of being ensorcelled and is subject to a posthypnotic
suggestion. The trigger is determined by the sorcerer;
it may be something seen or a spoken word. The player
must inform the referee what the specific trigger is, and
the referee must judge if it is appropriate. Once triggered,
a <i>suggestion</i> (q.v.) is effected. The spell is broken
after this <i>suggestion</i> is triggered and acted on, which
might be hours, days, months, or even years later.</p>"
