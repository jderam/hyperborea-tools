Desc: "<p>Transforms a 30-foot-diameter sphere of fresh or
salt water into a magical, bubbling solution that can
be inhaled safely by air-breathing creatures; furthermore,
underwater pressure is negated. The spell
can be cast as the sorcerer enters the water or after
submerging, the <i>air-like water</i> moving with the caster.
Water-breathing creatures will instinctively avoid the
sphere, as they cannot respire within its confines, but
this general eschewal does not preclude certain predators
of the deep from attempting to snatch prey from
the <i>air-like water</i>.</p>"
