Desc: "<p>The sorcerer can walk on air as though it were solid
ground and lead up to one recipient per CA level to
do the same. Each recipient must be touched and be
willing. In a straight, single-file line (such as over a
chasm, ravine, or trench), the sorcerer can lead recipients
to walk (but not run) at normal movement rate.
<i>Air walkers</i> also can walk up or down at a 45° angle, as
though ascending or descending stairs, at one-half normal
walking speed. Too, they can ascend or descend
vertically, as though climbing a sheer cliff with ample
handholds and toeholds, at one-fourth normal walking
speed. Any recipients that stray from the caster’s path
will fall and take damage.</p>"
