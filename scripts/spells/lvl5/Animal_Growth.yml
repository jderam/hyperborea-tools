Desc: "<p>Causes as many as six normal beasts (amphibians,
birds, fish, mammals, or reptiles; not humans, humanoids,
or monsters) to double in size. The effect results
in doubled hit dice, doubled damage dice, and whatever
else the referee deems appropriate. The reverse of this
spell, <i>animal reduction</i>, shrinks as many as six animals
to half their normal size, resulting in halved hit
dice and halved damage on attacks. No saving throw is
permitted for either form of this spell.</p>"
