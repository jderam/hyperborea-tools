Desc: "<p>Raised are the bones or carrion of Large animals: amphibians,
birds, mammals, and reptiles of natural sort.
The <b>large undead animals</b> will obey the simple instructions
of the caster (essentially one-word commands) and
follow the sorcerer unless slain or <i>turned</i>; the <i>dispel
magic</i> spell also nullifies the connexion betwixt the sorcerer
and the undead animal. The caster can <i>animate</i>
and maintain no more than 3 HD of undead animals per
CA level. <i>Animated carrion</i> loses any special abilities
possessed in life (e.g., flight, musk, venom).</p>"
