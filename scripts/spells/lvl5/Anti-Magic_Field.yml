Desc: "<p>Evokes a magical energy shield to surround the sorcerer
at a radius of one foot per CA level. The <i>anti-magic
field</i> repels any spell or sorcerous effect (as from a
ring, staff, wand, etc.); however, just as no spell or spell
effect can enter the shell, no spell or spell effect can
exit it, either.</p>"
