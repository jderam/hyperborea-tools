Desc: "<p>Usually cast on those of similar religion and/or like
alignment, this spell takes 1 hour to cast, following
prayer, cogitation, and incense burning. It removes the
onus of misdeeds that are unknowingly, unintentionally,
or unwillingly committed; also, this spell can undo
the effects of magical alignment change. If the recipient
has exercised poor judgment and consequently
violated the precepts of faith and/or alignment, this
spell can remove the burden or penalties accorded if
the character is truly repentant. Ultimately, the subjectâ€™s
contrition must be judged by the referee. One
cannot <i>atone</i> for deliberate misdeeds. The recipient
of the <i>atonement</i> spell might be charged with a <i>quest</i>
(q.v.) to complete his reparations.</p>"
