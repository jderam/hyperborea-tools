Desc: "<p>The lips of the sorcerer must be pursed after speaking
the final incantation of this spell, for the next time the
sorcerer’s mouth is opened, a jet of flames 10 feet long
and 5 feet wide at its terminus is released. Victims in
this path sustain 3d8+3 hp damage, though they can
attempt <i>avoidance</i> saving throws for half damage. The
sorcerer’s mouth may be opened at will to release this
spell, perhaps during combat or other like activities;
however, other spells may not be cast. If <i>breathe fire</i>
is not released within 1 turn (10 minutes), the sorcerer
immolates, sustaining maximum damage (27 hp) with
no saving throw applicable. (This spell can be dangerous
if the caster is forgetful and speaks to an ally or
another person.)</p>"
