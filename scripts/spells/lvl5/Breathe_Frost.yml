Desc: "<p>The lips of the sorcerer must be pursed after speaking
the final incantation of this spell, for the next time
the sorcerer’s mouth is opened, a billowing jet of frost
10 feet long and 5 feet wide at its terminus is released.
Victims in this path sustain 3d8+3 hp damage, though
they can attempt <i>avoidance</i> saving throws for half
damage. The sorcerer’s mouth may be opened at will
to release this spell, perhaps during combat or other
like activities; however, other spells may not be cast.
If <i>breathe frost</i> is not released within 1 turn (10 minutes),
the sorcerer internally freezes, sustaining maximum
damage (27 hp) with no saving throw applicable.
(This spell can be dangerous if the caster is forgetful
and speaks to an ally or another person.)</p>"
