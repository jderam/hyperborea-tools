Desc: "<p>This 24-hour ritual must be timed to coincide with a full
moon’s zenith (Phobos or Selene). The victim must be
bound to a tree or stone slab, suffering diabolical rites
that culminate with the sorcerer tracing a six-pointed
star on the victim’s breast with an ember-ended stick.
The change manifests in 3d8 days, and until that time
the victim will feel ill, suffering terrifying nightmares
that are impossible to recall; even the ritual endured is
but a vague memory. Ultimately, the victim is cursed
with <i>lycanthropy</i> and becomes a <b>werewolf</b>. The creature
cannot be controlled; however, it will not bring
harm to the caster. A <i>cure disease</i> spell cast by a
9th-level or greater cleric, priest, shaman, or witch can
end this affliction.</p>"
