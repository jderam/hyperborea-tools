Desc: "<p>A 30-foot-diameter, 20-foot-high cloud of poisonous,
green-yellow vapours is evoked by the sorcerer. The
cloud is heavy and clings low to the ground, much like
fog, rolling at 30 MV in a direction pointed by the caster.
Once the sorcerer points, the cloudâ€™s momentum
cannot be altered unless significant wind, which always
prevails over the will of the sorcerer, exists. Unusually
strong winds may disperse the cloud entirely. The
<i>cloudkill</i> spell slays any creature in its path with fewer
than 5 HD; creatures of 5 HD or more must roll <i>death</i>
(poison) saving throws or suffer 3d6 hp damage.</p>"
