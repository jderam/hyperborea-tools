Desc: "<p>The faithful servant of a deity, otherworldly being, or
alien power must pray and meditate for 3 turns to cast
this spell. The ritual must coincide with the burning of incense
and the handling of a holy symbol and prayer beads.
Other ritualistic sacrifices are open to interpretation.</p>
<p>Once the ritual is complete, the caster may ask the deific
patron as many as three questions. The patron will
answer correctly with a straightforward “yes “or “no.”
Ambiguous or convoluted questions will be ignored,
but still count against the three-question limit. This
spell can be cast but once per adventure or once per
month, as the referee deems appropriate.</p>"
