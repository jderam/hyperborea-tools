Desc: "<p>The sorcerer communicates with an elemental, animistic,
or ancestral spirit. The sorcerer must pray and
meditate for 3 turns to cast this spell. The ritual must
coincide with the burning of incense and the handling
of a carved wooden effigy. Other ritualistic sacrifices
are open to interpretation.</p>
<p>Once the ritual is complete, the caster may ask the patron
spirit as many as three questions. The spirit will
answer correctly with a straightforward “yes “or “no.”
Ambiguous or convoluted questions will be ignored,
but still count against the three-question limit. This
spell can be cast but once per adventure or once per
month, as the referee deems appropriate.</p>"
