Desc: "<p>This ritualistic spell requires 1 turn to cast and necessitates
the sacrifice of 500 gp, or gems of equal value.
The sorcerer must sit before a fire and chant in tongues
without being spoken to or interrupted. If these requisites
are met, the sorcerer contacts and seeks guidance
from an otherworldly being such as a spirit, dæmon,
deity, or demigod.</p>
<p>As many as three questions may be asked. The more
questions asked, the more information can be gleaned;
however, the more questions asked, the greater the
chance of becoming insane for daring to engage such
beings. Consult the following table after deciding how
many questions to ask. Your referee will secretly determine
and inform you of the results.</p>
<p><table><caption><b>Table 102: Contact Otherworldly Being Spell</b></caption>
<tr><th>Number of Questions</th><th>Veracity of Answer</th><th>Chance of Insanity</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>3:6</td><td>—</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>4:6</td><td>1:6</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>5:6</td><td>2:6</td></tr></table></p>
<p>Each question should be checked individually. Responses
will be simple, one-word answers: “Yes,” or
“No,” or “Maybe,” being the most common, though
“Futile,” or “Inconceivable,” or “Irrelevant,” or “Foolish,”
might also be the response. If two or three questions
are asked, and the second d6 roll so indicates, the
caster is driven mad within 1 turn. The insane sorcerer
will rant and rave incoherently, is unable to properly
care for himself or herself, and may prove combative
and self-destructive. Insanity will persist for as many
weeks as the number of questions asked. A cure madness
or remove curse spell can alleviate the insanity.</p>"
