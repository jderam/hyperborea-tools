Desc: "<p>This spell is cast outdoors, taking effect 1 turn after
being incanted. A minute or so before the effect manifests,
winds begin to swirl around the caster, rotating
in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The
sorcerer stands at the 15-foot-radius epicentre of the
effect, where the air remains calm.</p>
<p>Once the spell takes full effect, the winds develop into
a <i>strong gale</i>, or a 60-mph average; the caster may designate
a less potent wind force if desired. These winds
extend in a 240-foot hemispherical radius around the
caster, damaging buildings, bending or even uprooting
trees, driving away flying creatures, and affecting
sailed movement. The sorcerer can walk after casting
the spell and need not concentrate on it; the epicentre
of the winds moves with him or her. The caster can use
this spell to control otherwise prevailing winds (natural
or not) and can end the effect at will.</p>"
