Desc: "<p>The sorcerer evokes a 60-foot-diameter, 20-foot-high
cloud of hot black smoke; those within suffer intense
burning. Any creature 4 HD or fewer sustains 6d6 hp
damage, with no saving throw allowed. Creatures of
5 HD or greater are allowed <i>sorcery</i> saving throws for
half damage.</p>
<p>The damaging effects of this cloud are instantaneous;
i.e., they occur on the round the spell is cast. Afterwards,
the cloud remains for as many rounds as the
caster has CA levels. The remaining cloud induces
mild coughing, irritates the eyes, and obstructs the vision
of those within its confines. Missiles may be fired
10 feet into the cloud at a −4 penalty, but longer ranges
are impossible; melee within the cloud is likewise at
−4 “to hit” penalty. <i>N.B.:</i> If this spell is cast in an area
too small to confine its size, then the sorcerer too may
be subject to its effects.</p>"
