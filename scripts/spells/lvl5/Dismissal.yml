Desc: "<p>Banishes a creature of otherworldly, netherworldly,
or extra-dimensional origin. The common name of the
creature type must be known by the sorcerer; if the
creature has a proper name (such as a d√¶mon), then
this too must be known by the sorcerer or the spell cannot
be cast successfully. Some such creatures have <i>sorcery
resistance</i>, so this must be checked first. Next, the
target is allowed a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw (unless it does
not seek to resist). If the spell is successful, the victim
is swept away, usually to its realm of origin, though on
a 2-in-10 chance it is sent to some other random place.</p>
<p>The reverse of this spell, <i>beckon</i>, calls forth a creature
from another world or dimension, if its type and proper
name (if applicable) are known by the sorcerer. The same
<i>sorcery resistance</i> and saving throw method as described
above should be used. The <i>beckoned</i> creature materializes
10 feet before the sorcerer and may not be pleased about
being ripped so rudely from its home. Some sorcerers
seek to protect themselves from the <i>beckoned</i> by staying
within a candlelit magic circle. N.B.: Neither form of this
spell functions on creatures native to the world or dimension
in which the spell is cast.</p>"
