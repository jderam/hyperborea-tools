Desc: "<p>In a 30-foot radius, banishes Evil creatures summoned,
conjured, or enchanted by another sorcerer. Even
creatures of Neutrality can be banished if they were
conjured by an Evil sorcerer. Possible candidates include
<b>dæmons</b>, <b>elementals</b>, <b>invisible stalkers</b>, and the
undead. Each is allowed a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw to resist
the spell’s effect. Even if they make their saving throws,
they will vacate the area of effect for as long as the sorcerer
continues to chant. Alternatively, <i>dispel evil</i> can be
used as a touch spell on a single opponent, in which case
the saving throw is made at a −2 penalty. The reverse
of this spell, <i>dispel good</i>, is used by wicked sorcerers to
the same effect, albeit versus Good-aligned subjects and
other creatures controlled by agents of Good.</p>"
