Desc: "<p>Converts local materials into a desired shape or function.
A bridge may be built from stones, a house from
sticks and mud, or a raft from logs. Imagination is the
limit, though each such construction must be crude and
uncomplicated. The sorcerer can convert 10 cubic feet
of material per CA level; e.g., a CA 10 magician could
erect a bridge 1 foot thick, 5 feet wide, and 20 feet long.
Completing this spell requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet.</p>"
