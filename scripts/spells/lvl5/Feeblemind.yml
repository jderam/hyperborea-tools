Desc: "<p>This enchantment affects humans or other creatures
who cast spells. Creatures with innate spell-like abilities
do not qualify unless they too are spell casters.
The target must make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified
by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable. If the target
is of higher CA than the caster, the save is made at a
+1 bonus per level difference; conversely, if the target
is of lesser CA than the caster, the save is made at a
âˆ’1 penalty per level difference. If the save fails, the
victim becomes a drooling idiot, an invalid incapable of
coherent speech or thought and likewise incapable of
controlling bodily functions. <i>Feeblemind</i> is negated by
<i>dispel magic</i> or cured by a <i>heal</i> spell.</p>"
