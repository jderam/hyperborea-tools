Desc: "<p>The sorcerer points at a target and utters a baleful
incantation; from the sorcerer’s finger emits a death
ray. The target must make a <i>death</i> saving throw or die.
For every point of difference between the sorcerer’s
CA and the target’s level/HD, the saving throw is
modified by ±1. So, if a CA 11 sorcerer casts this spell
against a 12th-level fighter, the fighter gains a +1 bonus
to the saving throw; if the target is a 7th-level fighter,
the saving throw is rolled at a −4 penalty. This sorcery
is associated with dæmonism, so if not already Evil,
the caster will likely gravitate to that ethos through its
indiscriminate use; for clerics and druids, excommunication
may result.</p>"
