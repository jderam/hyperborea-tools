Desc: "<p>Evokes a column of roaring fire to descend from the
air, perhaps immolating a sacrifice to whatever power
or otherworldly being the sorcerer serves. The <i>flame
strike</i> is 50 feet high and 10 feet in diameter. Any creature
in the area of effect suffers 6d8 hp damage, with
a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw allowed for half damage. This
spell is popular with druids who sacrifice victims (often
criminals) via wicker man effigy.</p>"
