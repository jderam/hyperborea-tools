Desc: "<p>Causes the victimâ€™s skeleton to become viscous. Unless
a <i>transformation</i> saving throw is made, the victim
collapses to a blubbery glob of flesh, still breathing
but unable to move and hardly able to eat or drink
unless assisted. The victim cannot manipulate objects,
speech is limited to grunts and groans, and breathing
is a terrible labour. Death is inevitable, usually transpiring
within two to four weeks, though some victims
have been known to survive for months or even years
if provided constant care. Means do exist by which this
curse can be undone: the spells <i>heal</i> or <i>regeneration</i>,
but the process is painful, causing 3d6 hp damage and
requiring a <i>trauma survival</i> check to survive the ordeal
(see <b>Chapter 3: Statistics</b>, <i>constitution</i>).</p>"
