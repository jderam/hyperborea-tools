Desc: "<p>A blast of crystalline blue frost explodes from the sorcerer’s
down-stretched hands, creating a 2½-foot-wide,
six-inch-thick plane of ice underfoot. With full concentration,
the sorcerer continues to animate the ice, riding
on it as it forms a constant slide or viaduct, propelling
the caster forwards at a rate of 40 MV. The <i>ice bridge</i>
can form in a straight line, up or down at a maximum 45°
angle, and/or curved to a 45° angle. The <i>ice bridge</i> need
not stay affixed to its point of origin—in fact, it oft crumbles
away behind the sorcerer—but if the sorcerer does
not connect to stable ground by the end of the spell, or
if concentration is disrupted, falling is unavoidable. An
ally can hold onto the sorcerer’s waist and catch a ride
on the <i>ice bridge</i> if the sorcerer is of at least average
(9–12) strength; two riders may be conveyed if the sorcerer
is of above-average (13+) strength.</p>"
