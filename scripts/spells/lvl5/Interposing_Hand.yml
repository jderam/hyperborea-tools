Desc: "<p>A giant disembodied hand appears between the sorcerer
and a selected enemy, floating and providing cover.
The <i>interposing hand</i> presents a constant obstruction,
remaining betwixt the two, whilst the sorcerer can go
on to cast other spells or perform other actions. The
<i>interposing hand</i> pushes against an approaching enemy,
effectively limiting movement to a maximum rate
of 10 MV. The <i>interposing hand</i> is AC 0 and has as
many hit points as the sorcerer at full health.</p>"
