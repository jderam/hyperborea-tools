Desc: "<p>The sorcerer’s life force is placed in a small, inanimate
object. If it remains within 30 feet of the sorcerer’s
physical body, an attempt to possess another living
creature within 120 feet may be made. If the target fails
its <i>sorcery</i> saving throw (modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>,
if applicable), it will be possessed by the sorcerer.</p>
<p>A possessed body can be controlled like a puppet,
performing normal actions and using all its special
abilities (including spells), though not the possessor’s
original abilities or spells. Fragmentary memories of
the possessed might be accessed by the possessor; the
details should be nebulous, provided by the referee.
Note the potential consequences of this spell:</p>
<ul><li>If the body of the possessed is destroyed, the
spirit of the sorcerer returns to the <i>magic
jar</i>. The sorcerer’s spirit may then attempt to
possess another or return to its own body.</li>
<li>If the sorcerer’s body is destroyed whilst its
spirit is without, then the spirit must forever
remain in the body it presently possesses; or,
if the spirit is in the <i>magic jar</i>, it may possess
another, but permanently.</li>
<li>If the <i>magic jar</i> is destroyed whilst the sorcerer’s
spirit is inside it, the sorcerer’s physical
body will die, and his or her spirit is forever lost.</li>
<li>If the <i>magic jar</i> is destroyed whilst the sorcerer’s
spirit possesses another, the spirit must
forever remain in the body of the possessed.</li></ul>
<p>Possession is prevented by a <i>protection from evil</i> spell.
It can be terminated by a <i>remove curse</i> spell, sending
the sorcerer’s spirit back to the <i>magic jar</i>. Casting a
<i>magic jar</i> spell may be considered an act of Evil, depending
on the circumstances.</p>"
