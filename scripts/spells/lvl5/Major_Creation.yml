Desc: "<p>Effects the creation of an object composed of metal,
stone, or wood. The object can be no greater than one
cubic foot in size per CA level. To create the item, the
sorcerer must have some piece of the material to be produced;
i.e., if the sorcerer wishes to generate a block of
granite, then a small piece of granite must be possessed;
if the sorcerer wishes to fashion an iron anchor, then a
fragment of iron must be possessed. Note that objects
fashioned of wood enjoy double duration. The item will
disappear when the spell ends, as will the component.</p>"
