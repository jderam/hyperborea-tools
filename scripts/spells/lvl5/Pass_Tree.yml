Desc: "<p>Creates a mystical portal in the trunk of a tree with
a diameter of at least 2½ feet. The sorcerer and comrades
(one per CA level) may then <i>pass</i> through the
tree, exiting from another tree of similar size within
300 feet, as chosen by the caster. The portal is 2 × 5
feet and remains open for as long as the caster desires,
to a maximum of 1 turn per CA level. If <i>passing</i>
through alone, the sorcerer may choose to delay exiting,
remaining within the initial or destination tree, but
if the duration elapses, painfully will the sorcerer be
ejected for 3d6 hp damage. Whilst dwelling within the
confines of a tree, the sorcerer may observe what transpires
without, undetectable unless <i>true seeing</i> is cast.</p>"
