Desc: "<p>The sorcerer creates an illusion of an unremarkable
portal. At a time of the caster’s choosing (within the
spell’s duration), the sorcerer will appear to enter the
door and close it behind him or her. The sorcerer has
in fact stepped away in a state of <i>invisibility</i>, which
persists as long as this spell lasts.</p>
<p>If the <i>phantasmal door</i> is opened, it reveals a 10 × 10-foot
room that appears vacant and presents no egress.
The room has quasi-actuality; if entered, it is truly
there, but once the spell ends it will eject its occupants.
No saving throw can resist the effects of this spell;
however, <i>dispel phantasm</i> can disrupt it.</p>"
