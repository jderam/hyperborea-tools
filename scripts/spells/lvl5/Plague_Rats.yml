Desc: "<p>Conjures forth 1d6 plague-infested black <b>rats</b>. The
rats must be directed by the caster to attack a victim.
The rats attack on the next round and continue to do
so until slain or until their victim is dead. The caster is
free to perform other actions whilst this occurs.</p>
<p><i>Plague rats</i> carry a contagious and deadly disease.
Bite victims must make a <i>death</i> (poison) saving throw
or suffer <i>plague</i> (as <i>inflict disease</i>, the reverse form
of <i>cure disease</i> [q.v.]). This variation of the disease,
however, is contagious; anyone who comes in contact
with the victim must also make a <i>death</i> (poison) saving
throw or suffer the same malady. The <i>plague</i> is aggressive
and airborne; within one week of affliction, the victim
will develop a cough that might, per the refereeâ€™s
discretion, affect others through proximity or physical
contact with infected objects (e.g., door handles, food,
tools). The disease is likely to kill its victims within four
months, not one year as <i>inflict disease</i> suggests.</p>"
