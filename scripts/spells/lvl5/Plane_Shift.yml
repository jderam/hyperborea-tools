Desc: "<p>The sorcerer and as many as six allies (all holding
hands) shift to another plane of existence: a realm
unseen, a place of shadows, smoke, death, and destruction,
where all is ruin and where dwell forlorn spirits,
shadowy beasts, and other nameless horrors endure.
Those transported by <i>plane shift</i> are cursed to forever
remain in this realm of despair unless brought back by
the sorcerer or some other agent. Encounters in this
shadowy realm are entirely possible, as the referee will
determine, and frequent visitors are more likely to garner
attention. If this spell is used offensively to banish
an opponent, the target must be of 6 HD or fewer and is
allowed a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw to resist its effects.</p>"
