Desc: "<p>The illusionist creates a semi-opaque wall in which all
seven colours of the visible spectrum move and scintillate
in rotating bands. The wall may be as large as
60 feet long and 20 feet high or may form a circle 30
feet in diameter and 15 feet high. <i>Prismatic wall</i> is
immobile; only the caster may pass through it without
suffering harm; any other creature that attempts to
pass through is affected by two or more colours. Roll a
d8 twice to determine which colours affect the victim—
possibly three rolls if an <i>8</i> is one of the results.</p>
<p><table><caption><b>Table 109: Prismatic Wall Results</b></caption>
<tr><th>d8 Result</th><th>Prismatic Wall Effect</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Red band inflicts 2 hp of burning damage
per CA level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Orange band that inflicts 3 hp of burning
damage per CA level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yellow band that permanently blinds the
target unless a <i>sorcery</i> save is made; blind
creatures always lose initiative and suffer
−4 “to hit,” −4 AC, and −4 saving throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Green band that poisons the victim; <i>death</i>
(poison) saving throw or immediate death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Blue band that paralyzes the victim for 3d4
turns unless a <i>death</i> saving throw is made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Indigo band causes the target to suffer intense
hallucinations for 1d6 turns per the
<i>madness</i> rules (see <b>Table 148</b>) unless a <i>sorcery</i>
save is made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Violet band that throws target backward
2d6 feet and <i>stuns</i> the creature for 3d4
rounds; <i>sorcery</i> saving throw negates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Struck by three colours; roll three times,
ignoring results of 8.</td></tr></table></p>
<p>A <i>prismatic wall</i> may be destroyed by a <i>dispel phantasm</i>
spell or by use of <i>dispel magic</i>; for the latter,
however, one such spell is required for each colour in
succession: red, orange, etc.</p>"
