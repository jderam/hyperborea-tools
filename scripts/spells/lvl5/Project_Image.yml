Desc: "<p>A duplicate likeness of the sorcerer is created within 240
feet. The image remains without need of concentration.
The sorcerer can then cast subsequent spells through
the <i>projected image</i>. The sorcerer can see through the
eyes of the projected image, but only if the eyes of the
actual body remain shut. The image is unaffected by
spells, save <i>dispel phantasm</i>; however, it disappears if
struck for damage by a melee or missile weapon.</p>"
