Desc: "<p>Compels the victim (human, humanoid, or giant) to
carry out some service or task until it is completed. To
resist the spell, the target may make a <i>sorcery</i> saving
throw, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.
The task must be reasonably achievable and not
a blatant death sentence, or the spell breaks after one
or two weeks. (One cannot be directed to jump off a
cliff, but one may be charged with a quest to climb a
dangerous cliff.)</p>
<p>Failure results in a curse as charged by the sorcerer who
laid the <i>quest</i> spell. When cast by a player character, the
resulting curse is up to the imagination of the player
(with referee approval). When cast by a non-player
character, the PC is at the mercy of the refereeâ€™s device.
The reverse of this spell, <i>remove quest</i>, can cancel
its effects or those of a <i>geas</i> spell, but <i>dispel magic</i> is
ineffective. If cursed by failure to complete the <i>quest</i>, a
<i>remove curse</i> spell also can negate the curse.</p>"
