Desc: "<p>Enables the sorcerer to restore a recently deceased
human or quasi-man to life. This powerful necromantic
spell entails ritual chanting, burning incense, and
flourishing a holy symbol over a period of 6 turns (1
hour). The cadaver must be whole and intact; any missing
parts will remain missing, but wounds, burns, and
other injuries will be healed (though leaving notable
scars). The time limit betwixt death and resurrection
is seven days, plus one day per CA level.</p>
<p>Once the spell is complete, the deceased subject must
roll a <i>trauma survival</i> check (see <b>Chapter 3: Statistics</b>,
<i>constitution</i>). If this roll succeeds, the victim is
<i>raised</i>, but is aged three years and permanently loses
1 point of constitution; furthermore, the subject requires
one week of complete bed rest before engaging
in rigorous activity. If the <i>trauma survival</i> check fails,
the person is truly dead and cannot be <i>raised</i>.</p>"
