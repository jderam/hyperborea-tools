Desc: "<p>A popular dweomer used to sequester spell books and
magic items. The sorcerer must first have a 2 × 2 ×
3-foot chest built by a master craftsman. Furthermore,
a tiny replica of that same chest must be crafted, about
the size of a ring box. The total cost can be no less than
2,000 gp, as the materials used might include the rarest
wood, mammoth ivory, gold hinges, and the like. The
sorcerer then enchants the chest and its tiny replica by
way of a 1-turn ritual.</p>
<p>The larger chest can contain one cubic foot of material
per CA level, regardless of its actual size, but living
creatures ruin the spell if placed within. Upon completion
of the spell, the larger chest disappears to some
nether realm within the Black Gulf. So long as the miniature
replica chest is kept safe, the larger one may
be recalled by the sorcerer at any time. If the <i>secret
chest</i> is not recalled before the duration elapses, it is
permanently lost to the illimitable depths of the Black
Gulf. Once the spell expires, a new set of chests must
be crafted before casting this spell again. A sorcerer
cannot maintain more than one <i>secret chest</i>.</p>"
