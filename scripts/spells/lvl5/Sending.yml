Desc: "<p>The sorcerer conveys a message to familiar person
(i.e., one whose name and appearance the sorcerer
knows). Range is not a factor, so long as the subject
inhabits the same world/dimension as the caster. The
sorcerer can send one word per CA level (not including
articles <i>a</i>, <i>an</i>, and <i>the</i>). The message is heard and understood
by any intelligent recipient but does not compel
obeisance. A message can be sent once with no save
allowed. If an unwilling recipient is subjected to more
than one <i>sending</i> within the same week, a <i>sorcery</i> saving
throw is permitted to reject subsequent sendings.</p>"
