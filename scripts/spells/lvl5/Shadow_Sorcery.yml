Desc: "<p>The sorcerer gathers negative energy from the Black
Gulf to mimic one of three different battle-magic spells
commonly used by magicians. Each variation manifests
uniquely; their effects, however, are slightly reduced
due to their quasi-reality. The caster may choose
the variation at the time of casting:</p>
<ul><li><i>Fireball:</i> As the spell, except inflicts 1d6−1 hp
damage (min. 1) per CA level; explodes with
violet-blue flames</li>
<li><i>Lightning Bolt:</i> As the spell, except inflicts
1d6−1 hp damage (min. 1) per CA level; erupts
as a dead black bolt of energy limned in blue</li>
<li><i>Magic Missile:</i> As the spell, except each inflicts
1d4 hp damage per CA level; unleash as black
bolts that leave a wake of purple fire</li></ul>"
