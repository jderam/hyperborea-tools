Desc: "<p>Allows the sorcerer to call upon the aid of one or more
robust beasts. The <i>summoned</i> animal type must be
specified. In Hyperborea, these animals may include
<b>1 polar bear</b>, <b>1 tiger</b>, or <b>3 dire wolves</b>. Rudely the
animals are conjured to a location within the spellâ€™s
range. At once the caster must charge the animals with
a simple, one-sentence task. The animals will hear, understand,
and be compelled to obey. The task might be
to fight, guard, work, or the like. Once the task is complete
the spell is ended, and the animals will disappear
whence they came.</p>"
