Desc: "<p>A rabid cloud of tiny bats is <i>summoned</i>, manifesting all
about the sorcerer, whose arms are spread wide. The
<i>bat swarm</i> will attack 1 round after being <i>summoned</i>,
surging forth as directed by the sorcerer. As long as
the caster concentrates and points at the target, the
victim suffers 5 hp damage per round.</p>
<p>Whilst engulfed, the victim cannot cast spells, missile
attacks are impossible, and melee attacks are at a
−4 “to hit” penalty. Other actions such as drinking a
potion, activating a magic item, using a magic ability,
etc. are subject to a 3-in-6 chance of failure. Too,
a <i>swarm</i> victim suffers a −4 AC penalty. Fleeing the
<i>swarm</i> may be the victim’s only recourse, for it can harass
only to the limit of the spell’s range. A <i>swarm</i> can
be directed to move to another opponent within range,
but 1 round will elapse for every 30 feet between the
targets. After being attacked, victims must make
<i>death</i> (poison) saves or suffer pain and burning from
the multitudinous sites of infection, followed by headaches,
muscle spasms, and difficulty swallowing. Death
will ensue in 2d6 days unless <i>cure disease</i> is cast.</p>"
