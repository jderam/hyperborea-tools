Desc: "<p>Sorcery transports a <b>lesser dæmon</b> from Underborea
as selected by the sorcerer, depending on need. The
dæmon will arrive 1 round after the spell is cast and
will perform its designated task, after which, dead
or alive, it will either disappear or turn on the caster
and/or any allies (see below). When casting this spell,
the sorcerer must explicitly state the <i>summoned</i> type:
“defender,” “illuminator,” or “seeker.”</p>
<ul><li><b>Defender</b>: <i>Summons</i> a random dæmon to
assault the sorcerer’s enemies as directed for
no longer than 6 rounds. The target(s) must be
pointed out straight away, or else the dæmon
will attack the sorcerer and/or any allies. If the
stated target(s) is defeated, the standard chance
of betrayal applies.

<li><b>Illuminator</b>: <i>Summons</i> a single <b>class xiv lesser
dæmon</b>. The beast can use its special <i>legend lore</i>
ability to determine the whereabouts of an artefact,
of which it will then inform the caster. If
the artefact does not exist, the beast will attack
the sorcerer and/or any comrades. Alternatively,
it can be called upon to use its <i>tongues</i> ability to
converse with any intelligent creature present.
Lastly, it instead can grant wisdom by use of its
<i>contact otherworldly being</i> ability, with no risk
of insanity. No matter the case, once the dæmon
has completed its service, the standard chance
of betrayal applies; however, in the latter case
(<i>contact otherworldly being</i>), each question
beyond the first increases the dæmon’s chance of
betrayal by 1-in-6.</li>
<li><b>Seeker</b>: <i>Summons</i> a single <b>class xv lesser
dæmon</b> to search and destroy. When the <i>seeker</i>
type is designated, the sorcerer also must
describe the prey (name, species, and so forth).
The dæmon then will <i>teleport</i> itself and the
sorcerer before said prey and attempt to slay
it, after which the standard chance of betrayal
applies. If no prey exists, the dæmon will attack
the sorcerer and/or any comrades. Alternatively,
this dæmon can be asked to <i>plane shift</i> the
sorcerer and as many as five allies. This act
of utter desperation cannot be undone by the
same or another lesser dæmon; it is permanent,
barring some other means of translocation. The
dæmon then either will disappear (laughing all
the while) or will turn on the sorcerer and any
allies (q.v.).</li></ul>
<p><i>Betrayal:</i> Dæmons are infamous for betrayal. Upon
completing their prescribed task, they may turn on the
sorcerer and/or any allies on a 1-in-6 chance. Dæmons
are, however, subject to morale checks during the
entire <i>summon dæmon</i> process. Those that fail will
attempt to flee (if possible), now permanent inhabitants
of Hyperborea that may one day seek revenge.
Wise sorcerers are known to take sanctuary within the
confines of a candlelit magic circle whilst casting and
maintaining this spell; of course, the magic circle will
only protect the sorcerer, not allies.</p>"
