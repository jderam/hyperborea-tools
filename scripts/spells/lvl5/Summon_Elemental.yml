Desc: "<p>This conjuration requires 1 turn to cast and may be
performed but once per day. The sorcerer <i>summons</i>
a <b>class I air</b>, <b>earth</b>, <b>fire</b>, or <b>water elemental</b>. The
conjured elemental will obey the bidding of the caster,
performing all actions, including labour or combat, to
the best of its ability.</p>
<p>The sorcerer must maintain constant concentration
on the elemental. If the sorcerer casts another spell,
enters combat, or does anything else that is sufficient
to interrupt concentration, the elemental will break
free and attempt to kill the sorcerer and/or any allies.
Wise sorcerers are known to take sanctuary within the
confines of a candlelit magic circle whilst casting and
maintaining this spell; of course, the magic circle will
only protect the sorcerer, not allies. The sorcerer can
dismiss the elemental at will, but not after concentration
has been disrupted.</p>"
