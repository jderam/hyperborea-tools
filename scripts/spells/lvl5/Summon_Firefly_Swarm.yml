Desc: "<p>The sorcerer <i>summons</i> 5d4 fist-sized <i>fireflies</i>, infernal
insects sheathed in green flames, which attack on
command. Each <i>firefly</i> has the following statistics: <b>MV</b>
0 (fly 50); <b>AC</b> 7; <b>HD</b> ½ (<b>hp</b> 1). The <i>firefly swarm</i> will attack
1 round after being <i>summoned</i>. The victim suffers
2 hp damage (3 hp for undead) per <i>firefly</i> per round, as
long as the caster concentrates and points at the target.</p>
<p>Whilst engulfed, the victim cannot cast spells, missile
attacks are impossible, and melee attacks are at a
−4 “to hit” penalty. Other actions such as drinking a
potion, activating a magic item, using a magic ability,
etc. are subject to a 3-in-6 chance of failure. Too,
a <i>swarm</i> victim suffers a −4 AC penalty. Fleeing the
<i>swarm</i> may be the victim’s only recourse, for it can harass
only to the limit of the spell’s range. A <i>swarm</i> can
be directed to move to another opponent within range,
but 1 round will elapse for every 30 feet between the
targets.</p>"
