Desc: "<p>Standing stationary and using sorcery to empower the
mind, the caster lifts an object and moves it vertically
and/or horizontally at 10 MV; also, minor manipulation
(e.g., twists, turns) is possible. The weight of the object
is limited to 25 pounds per CA level. If a living creature
is targeted (presuming it is within the weight limit), a
<i>sorcery</i> saving throw can be made to resist the effect.</p>"
