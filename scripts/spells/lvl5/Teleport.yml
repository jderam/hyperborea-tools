Desc: "<p>The sorcerer or another recipient is instantaneously
transported with all gear intact to any unoccupied
space on the same world/dimension. Distance is irrelevant.
An unwilling recipient may make a <i>sorcery</i> saving
throw to resist the spell (and see below). <i>Teleportation</i>
is dangerous sorcery. The less familiar with the destination
the caster is, the greater the risk of error and,
potentially, injury or death. Roll a d20 to determine the
results of the <i>teleport</i> spell:</p>
<p><table><caption><b>Table 120: Teleport Spell</b></caption>
<tr style=text-align:center><th colspan=3>Familiarity with Destination</th><th colspan=2 rowspan=3>Result of Spell</th></tr>
<tr style=text-align:center><th><i>Very Familiar</i></th><th><i>Somewhat Familiar</i></th><th><i>Vaguely Familiar</i></th></tr>
<tr style=text-align:center><th>d20 Result</th><th>d20 Result</th><th>d20 Result</th></tr>
<tr style=text-align:center><td>1–18</td><td>1–15</td><td>1–10</td><td>Success</td></tr>
<tr style=text-align:center><td>19</td><td>16–18</td><td>11–15</td><td>1d10×10 ft high</td></tr>
<tr style=text-align:center><td>20</td><td>19–20</td><td>16–20</td><td>1d10×10 ft low</td></tr></table></p>
<p>The three degrees of familiarity are defined as follows:</p>
<ul><li><i>Very Familiar:</i> The sorcerer has frequented the
location many times and knows it well.</li>
<li><i>Somewhat Familiar:</i> The sorcerer has been
to the location only a few times. (An unwilling
subject sent to a <i>somewhat familiar</i> location
gains a +2 saving throw bonus.)</li>
<li><i>Vaguely Familiar:</i> The sorcerer has been there
only once and did not stay for more than a brief
time. (An unwilling subject sent to a <i>vaguely
familiar</i> location gets a +4 saving throw bonus.)</li></ul>
<p>Success indicates the desired location has been
achieved without error. <i>Teleporting</i> too high may
result in a fall, in which case 1d6 hp damage should
be rolled for every 10 feet fallen. <i>Teleporting</i> too low
might cause one to appear in solid ground, in which
case death is instantaneous. (<i>Teleporting</i> the subject
to an occupied space cannot be intentional; the destination
must be an unoccupied location on solid ground.)
Exceptions can apply. For example, a sorcerer who
attempts to <i>teleport</i> to the ground floor of a two-storey
building might end up 20 feet too high, in which case he
appears on the roof.</p>"
