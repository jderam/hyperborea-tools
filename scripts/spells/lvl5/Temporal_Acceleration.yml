Desc: "<p>This illusion affects the minds of all within a 10-foot
radius, including the caster. Unwilling subjects are
allowed <i>sorcery</i> saving throws, modified by <i>willpower
adjustment</i>, if applicable. The affected believe the passage
of time is accelerated, the illusion being so powerful
that it becomes reality for all involved. For every
1 turn spent within the <i>temporal acceleration</i> area of
effect, time passes as though it were 6 turns; i.e., every
10 minutes effects a one-hour passage of time. One
hour is as six, four hours as twenty-four, and so on. As a
result, all bodily functions of the affected are hastened;
indeed, they must eat, drink, sleep, and so forth at the
accelerated rate. The durations of spells and innate
abilities are likewise quickened. <i>Temporal acceleration</i>
allows for rest, sleep, recovery of hit points, and
renewal of spells. <i>Dispel phantasm</i> disrupts this spell;
the sorcerer may also terminate it at any time.</p>"
