Desc: "<p>The sorcerer <i>transforms</i> into a <b>hell hound</b>. Upon
metamorphosis, the sorcerer is subject to the following
benefits and restrictions:</p>
<ul><li>Physical (AC, FA) and special abilities of the hell
hound are gained, including <i>breathe fire</i>.</li>
<li>The previous hit point total and saving throws of
the caster are retained.</li>
<li>Possessions are melded with the new form; the
caster no longer realizes their benefits, except
for magic rings.</li>
<li>Mental capacity is retained, though the sorcerer
is unable to cast other spells; speech changes to
the <i>infernal tongue</i> spoken by hell hounds and
other netherworldly species.</li></ul>
<p>The sorcerer can terminate the spell at will or await its
expiration. When the spell ends, the caster reverts to
his or her normal form and is healed of 2d6 hp damage
(if applicable). If killed whilst in hell hound form, the
sorcererâ€™s true appearance is revealed.</p>"
