Desc: "<p>The sorcerer <i>transforms</i> into a <b>winter wolf</b>. Upon
metamorphosis, the sorcerer is subject to the following
benefits and restrictions:</p>
<ul><li>Physical (AC, FA) and special abilities of the
winter wolf are gained, including <i>frost blast</i>, <i>immunity
to cold damage</i>, and <i>fire vulnerability</i>.</li>
<li>The previous hit point total and saving throws of
the caster are retained.</li>
<li>Possessions are melded with the new form; the
caster no longer realizes their benefits, except
for magic rings.</li>
<li>Mental capacity is retained, though the sorcerer
is unable to cast other spells; speech changes to
the uncanny language spoken by winter wolves.</li></ul>
<p>The sorcerer can terminate the spell at will or await its
expiration. When the spell ends, the caster reverts to
normal form and is healed of 2d6 hp damage (if applicable).
If killed whilst in winter wolf form, the sorcererâ€™s
true appearance is revealed.</p>"
