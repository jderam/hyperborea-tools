Desc: "<p>This dweomer takes effect 1 turn after casting, changing
earth, gravel, rock, or sand into mud. The sorcerer
is able to affect a cubic area with sides one foot
long per CA level; e.g., a CA 10 sorcerer can affect a
10 × 10 × 10-foot area. When the spell’s duration elapses,
the mud dries to dirt. If this spell takes effect under
the feet of an enemy, this foe may make an <i>avoidance</i>
saving throw to escape the muddy ground. Creatures
that enter the <i>transmuted</i> area move but five feet per
turn, so long as they are able to keep their heads above
the mud. If the depth of the mud is greater than their
height, they must make <i>transformation</i> saving throws
or be sucked in and die, as with quicksand. The reverse
of this spell, <i>transmute mud to rock</i>, hardens muddy
ground into solid stone. Creatures mired in the muddy
area must make <i>transformation</i> saving throws or
become trapped in solid stone (likely a fatal outcome).</p>"
