Desc: "<p>The sorcerer perceives things for what they really are.
A diamond of 500-gp value or greater must be sacrificed
to cast this spell. Upon speaking the incantation,
invisible creatures or objects are revealed; <i>phantasms</i>
and like illusions are exposed; mundane and magical
disguises are penetrated; secret doors are made obvious.
Even the subjects of spells such as <i>polymorph</i>
(<i>other</i> or <i>self</i>), <i>stone shape</i>, or <i>tree shape</i> are shewn by
<i>true seeing</i>. For those sorcerers casting the clerical/
druidic version of this spell, alignment is also cognized
by means of a projected aura, so Good, Evil, and Neutrality
are distinguished, as well as Law and Chaos.
The sorcerer can move (but not run) after casting this
spell, fully concentrating. Any other actions (combat,
other spells, item use, etc.) will break the spell.</p>"
