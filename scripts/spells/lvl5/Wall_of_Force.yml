Desc: "<p>Evokes an invisible, immoveable barrier that is impervious
to most spells, including <i>dispel magic</i>; however,
a <i>disintegrate</i> spell will destroy it. Weapons, missiles,
breath weapons, cold, fire, and acid attacks cannot
penetrate the <i>wall of force</i>. The <i>wall of force</i> can be
created to be as large as 20 feet high and 50 feet long;
or it can be a 20-foot-diameter hemisphere with a 10-
foot apex, the latter form serving as protection for the
sorcerer, if so desired.</p>"
