Desc: "<p>Evokes a giant mass of gnarly, resilient, pliable brush
to take form. These thick, tangled vines bristle with
dagger-like thorns of three- to five-inch length. The
sorcerer may shape the barrier as desired, as large as
1,000 cubic feet per CA level; for instance, a CA 10 sorcerer
may create a <i>wall of thorns</i> 50 feet long, 20 feet
deep, and 10 feet high. Creatures caught in the spellâ€™s
designated area of effect suffer 1d10+10 hp damage.
If one attempts to push through the <i>wall of thorns</i> or
otherwise comes into abrupt contact with it, similar
damage is sustained and repeated for every 10 feet of
movement within the mass.</p>
<p>To avoid additional damage, one can chop through with
a stout blade, such as a sword, axe, or heavy knife.
Cutting through 10 feet of this enchanted barrier requires
1 turn. Mundane fire will not harm the <i>wall of
thorns</i>, as the vines are coated with an oily enzyme;
magical fire will burn the <i>wall of thorns</i> within 1 turn
of contact, effecting a <i>wall of fire</i> spell that blazes for
a single turn.</p>"
