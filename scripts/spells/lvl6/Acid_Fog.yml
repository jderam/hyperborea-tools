Desc: "<p>Creates a caustic miasma as large as 10 feet thick,
30 feet long, and 30 feet high. Only 35 mph or greater
wind will disperse <i>acid fog</i>; even a <i>gust of wind</i> spell is
ineffective. <i>Acid fog</i> burns all within its confines and is
particularly deadly to vegetation, killing small plants
and grass at once. Humans, monsters, and other fauna
are harmed as well, the acid blistering their skin, eyes,
throat, and lungs. Such creatures sustain 1 hp damage
on the 1st round, 2 hp on the 2nd, 4 hp on the 3rd, 8 hp
on the 4th, 10 hp on the 5th, and 12 hp on the 6th; vegetal
creatures suffer 150% of these damage figures.</p>
<p>Any creature caught within or attempting to traverse
<i>acid fog</i> is slowed by the fogâ€™s opacity to a maximum
rate of 10 MV. Normal sight cannot penetrate <i>acid fog</i>,
and <i>infrared vision</i> is unavailing. Potent fire spells
such as <i>fireball</i>, <i>flame strike</i>, or <i>wall of fire</i> will burn
off <i>acid fog</i> in 1 round.</p>"
