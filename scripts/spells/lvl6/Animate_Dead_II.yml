Desc: "<p>Unspeakable rites and forbidden incantations raise
<b>ghouls</b> from the fresh graves of humans. The selected
graves must be no older than one week and dug properly.
The <b>ghouls</b> will claw out from the earth to obey
the commands of the sorcerer, following, attacking, or
standing guard as directed. They will continue to serve
until either slain or <i>turned</i>; the <i>dispel magic</i> spell also
nullifies the connexion betwixt the sorcerer and the
undead. Through this necromancy the sorcerer can
<i>animate</i> and maintain <b>1 ghoul</b> for every 2 CA levels. If
a 12th-level sorcerer casts this spell, the sixth ghoul will
emerge as a <b>ghast</b>.</p>"
