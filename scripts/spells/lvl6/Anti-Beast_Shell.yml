Desc: "<p>Creates an invisible, 10-foot-radius, hemispherical field
around the sorcerer. The barrier prevents any animal
from breaching the <i>anti-beast shell</i> or attacking those
within. This spell does not affect magical beasts or
“monsters”; only natural beasts of the animal kingdom
are hedged out: amphibians, arachnids, birds, fish,
insects, mammals, and reptiles, including giant-sized
species. Those afforded the protection of this spell cannot
attack or otherwise harm any animal outside the
<i>shell</i>, or the spell will terminate.</p>"
