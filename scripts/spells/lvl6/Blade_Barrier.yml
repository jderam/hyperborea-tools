Desc: "<p>The sorcerer conjures a 12-foot wall of whirling, keen-edged
blades that spin and flash around a selected
point, fencing in an area as small as 5 × 5 feet to as
large as 50 × 50 feet. Any creature that attempts to
pass through the <i>blade barrier</i> will be assailed by the
whirling blades, sustaining 8d8 hp damage. When
this spell is cast, targeted creatures are entitled to
an <i>avoidance</i> saving throw to escape harm; however,
there is a 3-in-6 chance that they escape within the
<i>blade barrier</i>, not without.</p>"
