Desc: "<p>Discharging from the fingertips of the sorcerer is an
arcing bolt of lightning. It strikes a designated target
for 1d6 hp damage per CA level (e.g., a CA 12 caster
discharges a 12d6 hp bolt). The target is afforded a
<i>sorcery</i> saving throw for half damage.</p>
<p><i>Chain lightning</i> will go on to strike the next closest object
(within the range of the spell), gravitating to metal
if present (e.g., an iron gate or a mail-clad warrior).
The spell does not distinguish betwixt the casterâ€™s enemies
and inanimate objects; i.e., it will strike a keg of
ale before it strikes a monster if the keg is closer to the
primary target. Each time the lightning strikes another
target, it delivers one fewer die of damage. So, if a CA
12 sorcerer discharges a 12d6 hp bolt, the second target
(human, monster, or object) sustains 11d6 hp damage.
Each subsequent target also gets a saving throw.</p>
<p><i>Chain lightning</i> will continue to strike as many objects
as the caster has CA levels. It can strike each target
only once, and it always stays within the range of the
spell. If it strikes a large tree, iron rod, or other like
attractor, the lightning will be diffused. This spell is
potentially dangerous to the caster: It can arc back and
strike the caster if no other targets are in range, or if
the caster is perilously close to the primary target.</p>
<p><i>Example:</i> A CA 12 sorcerer discharges <i>chain lightning</i>
at a group of <b>7 orcs</b> standing by an oak tree 100 feet
away. The first orc is struck for 12d6 hp, the second for
11d6 hp, and the third for 10d6 hp, but the next closest
target is the tree, which diffuses the bolt. If the tree were
not present, the bolt would strike all 7 orcs and then arc
back to the caster for 5d6 hp damage. Of course, a save
can reduce each strike to half damage.</p>"
