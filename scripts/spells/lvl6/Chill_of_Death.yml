Desc: "<p>The sorcerer points at a target and utters an incantation
of death frost. The target must make a <i>death</i>
saving throw or suffer a frozen heart (or another vital
organ). For every point of difference between the sorcerer’s
CA and the target’s level/HD, the saving throw
is modified by ±1. So, if a CA 12 sorcerer casts this
spell against a 13-HD monster, the monster gains a +1
bonus to its saving throw; if the target is an 8-HD monster,
the saving throw is rolled at a −4 penalty. If the
target lacks vital organs (e.g., <b>automaton</b>, <b>skeleton</b>,
<b>zombie</b>), this spell is ineffective.</p>"
