Desc: "<p>Allows the sorcerer to speak with any creature that
possesses even the most rudimentary communicational
ability. The monster will understand the intent of the
sorcererâ€™s words if not the precise language. Monsters
of the same species as the initial target will likewise understand
the message. Of course, such communication is
also contingent on the creature wishing to converse with
the caster; instead, it may prefer to eat the sorcerer.</p>"
