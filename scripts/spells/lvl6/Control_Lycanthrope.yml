Desc: "<p>The sorcerer controls the actions of a single <b>lycanthrope</b>,
commanding the cursed beast. No saving
throw is allowed. The lycanthrope views the caster as a
trusted master to be protected and defended throughout
the duration of the spell. If caster and lycanthrope
speak the same language, the caster can direct the
beast to perform various tasks, so long as they are not
diametrically opposite to the creatureâ€™s nature; if such
becomes the case, the beast is allowed a <i>sorcery</i> saving
throw to break the control.</p>"
