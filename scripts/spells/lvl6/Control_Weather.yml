Desc: "<p>This spell is cast outdoors, requiring 2 turns (20 minutes)
to take effect in a 2d6-square-mile area. The
sorcerer can stand within the epicentre of the effect,
or 300 yards outside its verge, and can <i>control weather</i>
for as long as he or she concentrates. Possibilities
include:</p>
<ul><li><i>Rain:</i> Visibility compromised; missile attacks at
−2 “to hit,” movement reduced to half.</li>
<li><i>Snow:</i> Visibility reduced to 20 feet, with snow
collecting at 2 inches per hour: −10 MV at
6 inches; −20 MV at 12 inches.</li>
<li><i>Fog:</i> Visibility reduced to 20 feet.</li>
<li><i>Clear/Partly Cloudy Skies:</i> Cancels the effects
of stormy weather.</li>
<li><i>Blistering Heat:</i> Temperature rises to 100°F.</li>
<li><i>Frigid Cold:</i> Temperature drops to 0°F.</li>
<li><i>High Winds:</i> Gale winds (40–50 mph) prevent
missile fire and can drive flying creatures to the
ground; this bluster can benefit sailing ships (at
the lower range of gale power), increasing vessel
speed by 50% or more.</li>
<li><i>Hail:</i> Hail batters all in the area, reducing
movement by half and damaging roofs and other
structures.</li>
<li><i>Tornado:</i> A thunderhead manifests under which
a powerful whirlwind forms. The tornado is 500
feet in diameter and moves as directed by the
sorcerer. Creatures of 1–2 HD in its path must
make <i>avoidance</i> saves or be swept away, suffering
3d8 hp damage, being hurled 1d10×10 feet
in the air, and falling for another 1d6 hp damage
per 10 feet. Creatures of 3 HD or more must
make <i>avoidance</i> saves or sustain 3d8 hp damage,
but are not hurled in the air. This form of <i>control
weather</i> persists only 1 round per CA level.</li></ul>"
