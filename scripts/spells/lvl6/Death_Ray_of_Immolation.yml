Desc: "<p>The sorcerer points at a target and utters an incantation
of fire. The target must make a <i>death</i> saving throw
or explode into flames, suffering instant death. For every
point of difference between the sorcerer’s CA and
his target’s level/HD, the saving throw is modified by
±1. So, if a CA 11 sorcerer casts this spell against a
12th-level fighter, the fighter gains a +1 saving throw
bonus; if the target is a 7th-level fighter, the saving
throw is rolled at a −4 penalty; and so forth.</p>"
