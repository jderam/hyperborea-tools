Desc: "<p>Gathers negative energy from the Black Gulf to mimic
three spells typically associated with magicians. Each
variation manifests uniquely; the effects, however, are
somewhat reduced due to their quasi-reality. The caster
may choose the variation at the time of casting:</p>
<ul><li><i>Cone of Cold:</i> as the spell, except that it drains
1d4 hp damage per CA level, so a CA 12 caster
unleashes a cone that delivers 12d4 hp damage.
The cone is jet black.</li>
<li><i>Fire Shield:</i> as the spell, except that successful
melee attacks against the sorcerer cause the
attacker to sustain Ã—1.5 the amount of damage
inflicted. The cold-resistant form is midnight
blue, and the fire-resistant form is blood red.</li>
<li><i>Wall of Fire:</i> as the spell, except that the wall
inflicts 3d4 hp damage, +1 hp per CA level,
versus creatures of 4 HD or greater. Undead
sustain 5d4 hp damage, +1 hp per CA level.
The flames are violet-black.</li></ul>"
