Desc: "<p>The sorcerer names a specific place upon uttering
this spell; the direction of that place, whether visited
before, is known throughout the duration of the spell.
Furthermore, the sorcerer will, through otherworldly
guidance, apprehend the most efficient way to achieve
the location, retaining this information even after the
spell’s duration has elapsed. For example, if a crevasse
presents an obstacle, the sorcerer will understand the
best way around it, even comprehending the existence
of a secret door that must be accessed in order to
reach the chosen place. Even traps may be avoided.
If, for example, Saturn is sought, the location of a
rocket ship or teleportation device might be gleaned.
Once the spell’s duration has elapsed, the sorcerer
retains a general idea of what must be done; however,
any attempt to map, record, or otherwise disclose
this data to others will cause the <i>path</i> to be forgotten.</p>
<p>The reverse of this spell, <i>forget the path</i>, is a touch
spell that causes its victim to become lost and wander
aimlessly for the duration of the spell unless they make
a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>,
if applicable.</p>"
