Desc: "<p>This dweomer is laid on six small nuts (acorn, walnut,
etc.) or six small berries (blueberry, holly, etc.), each
type effecting a different result. A nut becomes a <i>fire
seed</i> missile, and a berry becomes a <i>fire seed</i> bomb.</p>
<ul><li><i>Fire Seed Nut:</i> A nut (fire seed missile) can be
thrown as a grenade at a target within 40 feet.
This is executed by use of the <i>flask hurling</i> rules
(see <b>Chapter 9: Combat</b>, <i>combat options</i>). A
miss indicates the missile was ineffective, the
nut lost. If a hit is scored, the <i>fire seed</i> explodes
in a burst of flame, delivering 2d8+4 hp damage
to all within 10 feet of the target. The stricken
target is not allowed a saving throw, but those
within 10 feet are permitted <i>sorcery</i> saving
throws for half damage.</li>
<li><i>Fire Seed Berry:</i> Berries (<i>fire seed</i> bombs) must
be placed within the spellâ€™s range (though not
necessarily by the caster). The caster designates
a spoken word that detonates the berries, each
one bursting into a 10-foot-diameter gout of
flame that causes 1d8+4 hp damage. The berries
can be piled together for a cumulative effect
or spread out as the sorcerer desires (perhaps
creating a wall of flames). Victims are allowed
<i>sorcery</i> saving throws for half damage.</li></ul>
<p>Regardless of the type created, <i>fire seeds</i> are of limited
duration if not discharged: They remain enchanted for
6 turns (1 hour) per CA level, and their dweomer vanishes
if they go unused.</p>"
