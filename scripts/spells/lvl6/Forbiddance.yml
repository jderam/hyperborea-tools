Desc: "<p>Enforces a <i>ceremony of consecration</i> spell. Laying
this dweomer requires a 12-turn (2-hour) ritual. Holy
oil/water must be sprinkled about the perimeter of
the <i>consecrated</i> area whilst casting this spell. Creatures
of like alignment and/or faith as the caster
might be instructed in a special prayer or password
to enter the <i>forbidden</i> area. Without knowledge of the
prayer/password, entry is impossible unless <i>sorcery</i>
saving throws are made, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>,
if applicable. Creatures whose alignment and/or
faith are in opposition to the caster’s cannot enter—
even if they know the prayer/password—unless they
make <i>sorcery</i> saving throws. If the saves fail, interlopers
each suffer 4d6 hp damage, as well as a painful
wracking of the body for every turn that they remain in
the <i>forbidden</i> area. Otherwise, trespassers who make
their saves feel sickened and nauseous whilst within
the <i>forbidden</i> area.</p>"
