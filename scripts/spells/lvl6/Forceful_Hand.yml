Desc: "<p>A giant disembodied hand appears between the sorcerer
and a selected opponent. The <i>forceful hand</i>
presents a constant obstruction, remaining betwixt the
two, whilst the sorcerer can go on to cast subsequent
spells or perform other actions. The <i>forceful hand</i> is
aggressive, pushing back the target at a rate of 10 MV
to the maximum range of the spell, unless the target
weighs more than 500 pounds; if such is the case, the
hand effectively functions as an <i>interposing hand</i> spell
(q.v.), slowing the approach of the enemy to 10 MV.</p>
<p>If the hand pushes an enemy to a wall or other obstruction,
it will hold the victim there until the spell ends
or the sorcerous hand is destroyed. The <i>forceful hand</i>
is AC 0 and has as many hit points as the sorcerer at
full health. Otherwise, only an <i>extraordinary feat of
strength</i> allows one to escape. This may require the
referee to dice for a monster’s strength on the spot,
using 3d6 for an average creature, 4d6 drop low for a
more robust creature, 4d6 drop high for a Small creature—
or simply assign a reasonable strength score.</p>"
