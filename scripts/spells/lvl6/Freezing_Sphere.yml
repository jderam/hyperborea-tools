Desc: "<p>This dweomer requires the sacrifice of a 500-gp sapphire.
It evokes a two-inch-diameter sphere of bluewhite
ice that appears in the palm of the caster and can
be implemented in three different manners:</p>
<ul><li><i>Ice Bullet:</i> The sphere can be hurled using the
<i>flask hurling</i> rules (see <b>Chapter 9: Combat</b>,
<i>combat options</i>) or launched from a sling as an
<i>ice bullet</i>. Wherever it strikes, the <i>ice bullet</i>
bursts, delivering 6d6 hp cold damage to all
within a 20-foot radius of the blast. A <i>sorcery</i>
saving throw is permitted for half damage.</li>
<li><i>Ice Sheet:</i> The sphere can be tossed into a body
of water such as a lake, pond, or river, effecting
an <i>ice sheet</i> on the surface six inches in depth
and covering 100 square feet per CA level. The
<i>ice sheet</i> persists for as long as logic dictates,
based on prevailing weather.</li>
<li><i>Ray of Cold:</i> The sorcerer can pinch the sphere,
releasing a thin <i>ray of cold</i> that extends 10 feet
per CA level. The aimed <i>ray of cold</i> moves in a
straight line and passes through all in its path,
inflicting 4 hp damage per CA level. All damage
is negated if <i>sorcery</i> saving throws are made.</li>
<p>The <i>freezing sphere</i> can be held by the caster for
1 turn per CA level. If the caster does not use the
sphere before then, it explodes as an <i>ice bullet</i> with no
saving throw allowed.</p>"
