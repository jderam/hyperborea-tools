Desc: "<p>Compels the victim (human, humanoid, or giant) to
complete a service or task. To resist the spell, the
target may make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by
<i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable. The task must
be reasonably achievable and not a blatant death sentence,
or the spell breaks after one or two weeks. (One
cannot be directed to fall on his sword, but if <i>geased</i> by
a sorcerer high atop Mount Vhuurmithadon, a fighting
man might be commanded to find and offer himself to
Xathoqqua.) If the <i>geased</i> individual fails or refuses
to carry out the appointed task, the individual suffers
weakness and will die after one or two weeks. <i>Geas</i>
cannot be broken by <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>remove curse</i>.
Only the reverse of this spell, <i>remove geas</i>, can break
the effects of a <i>geas</i>; too, it can negate a <i>quest</i> spell.</p>"
