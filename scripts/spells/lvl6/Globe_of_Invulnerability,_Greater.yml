Desc: "<p>An invisible field surrounds the sorcerer in a three-foot
radius, protecting against all level 1â€“5 spells except
<i>dispel magic</i>, which negates the effect. The sorcerer
can cast spells from within the <i>globe</i>. The <i>globe</i> does
not negate the sorcery of devices (magic rods, staves,
wands, rings, etc.).</p>"
