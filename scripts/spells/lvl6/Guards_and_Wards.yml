Desc: "<p>The sorcerer uses this dweomer to protect a tower or
other stronghold. The warded area can be a cube with
sides as large as 10 feet per CA level; e.g., a CA 12
sorcerer can affect an area as large as 120 × 120 × 120
feet. The effects are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Pale green mist fills corridors, limiting visibility
to 10 feet.</li>
<li>All doors/gates are <i>sorcerer locked</i> (q.v.).</li>
<li>One door per CA level is covered by a
<i>phantasm</i> (q.v.) to appear as a wall.</li>
<li>Stairs are filled with <i>webs</i> (q.v.).</li>
<li>Intersections and forks invoke a minor form of
the <i>confusion</i> spell in which the intruder turns
in a direction he did not intend.</li></ul>
<p>The sorcerer can also select one of the following optional
effects:</p>
<ul><li><i>Dancing lights</i> (q.v.) in as many as four corridors</li>
<li><i>Magic mouths</i> (q.v.) placed in two locations</li>
<li><i>Stinking clouds</i> (q.v.) placed in two locations</li>
<li><i>Suggestion</i> (q.v.) placed in one location</li></ul>
<p>If <i>detect magic</i> is cast, the entire area of effect radiates
potent magic. Each effect of this spell should be considered
a separate dweomer for <i>dispel magic</i> attempts.</p>"
