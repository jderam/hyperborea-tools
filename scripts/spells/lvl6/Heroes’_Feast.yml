Desc: "<p>Conjures a grand banquet that feeds a number of
people equal to the sorcerer’s CA. Casting this spell
requires the use of a holy symbol, prayer beads,
and/or incense. The <i>heroes’ feast</i> appears on a great
table surrounded by as many chairs as needed. The
<i>feast’s</i> main course might be roasted pig, stuffed
pheasant, butter and dill fried cod, boiled lobster, or
the like; it also includes appetizers, side dishes, greens,
legumes, beer, wine, and more. The courses are served
by a half-dozen <i>unseen servants</i> (q.v.), though they
perform in no other capacity than to serve the <i>feast</i>.
Consuming the meal requires one hour. Thereafter, the
<i>feasters</i> experience a mild ambrosial effect by which
they are immune to poison, disease, and sorcerous fear
for 12 hours; too, they are healed of 1d8+4 hp damage,
and they enjoy the effects of a <i>bless</i> spell (q.v.) for 1d8
hours. If the <i>feast</i> is interrupted, however, no benefits
will be realized.</p>"
