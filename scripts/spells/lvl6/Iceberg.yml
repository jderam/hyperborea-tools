Desc: "<p>The sorcerer conducts a 6-turn (1-hour) ritual that requires
the sacrifice of 1,000 gp in gold or gems and the
proximity of a significant body of water. Conjured ice
rises from the water, forming a small, pinnacle-shaped
<i>iceberg</i> that functions as a three-storey shelter with
a 30 × 30-foot “ground” floor (below water level), a
20 × 20-foot first floor, and a 10 × 10-foot second floor.
The <i>iceberg</i> can be fashioned to have transparent ice
windows, a solid gate (usually at the first floor), a chimney,
and other simple effects that are composed of ice:
a table, chairs, and bunkbeds, if so desired. The magic
<i>iceberg</i> enjoys other enchantments as well:</p>
<ul><li>Impervious to normal fire and missiles
(arrows and quarrels).</li>
<li>Can withstand gale-force winds and remain
buoyant.</li>
<li>Its gate has a <i>sorcerer lock</i> (q.v.), and each
window has the strength of iron.</li>
<li>Contains three <i>unseen servants</i> (one at each
storey) with the sole functions of maintaining
the cleanliness of the place and assisting with
cooking, stoking the fire, and so forth.</li></ul>
<p>From the second-floor window, the sorcerer can direct
the <i>iceberg</i> to float 60 feet per round, or 24 miles per
day. The <i>iceberg</i> will begin to crumble when the spell’s
duration elapses, so bringing a raft or canoe is always
wise. An expiring <i>iceberg</i> can be preserved if the spell
is recast and the requisite sacrifice met again.</p>"
