Desc: "<p>Provides knowledge of some fabled artefact or locale.
The referee must judge whether the thing or place is
sufficiently legendary to qualify; if not, the spell fails. If
the subject is indeed legendary, the information will be
gleaned via a dream or vision some 1d10 days later, as
secretly determined by the referee. The <i>lore</i> revealed
by this spell is oft cryptic in nature and may be learnt
in the form of a picture, poem, riddle, sign, or symbol.</p>"
