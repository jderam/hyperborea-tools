Desc: "<p>Usually cast on an oak tree, though any hardwood can be
used, so long as it is at least 18 feet in height. The tree animates,
transforming to a <b>16-HD tree-man</b>, whose function
is to protect a person, place, or thing as prescribed
by the sorcerer. This animation triggers when a specific
condition, set by the caster, is met; e.g., “If any creature
comes within 30 feet of this camp, animate!” The <i>liveoak</i>
attacks as a normal tree-man, except it can go no farther
than 120 feet from its original location and cannot summon
other tree-men. This spell can be negated by a <i>dispel
magic</i> spell, or the caster may end it at will.</p>"
