Desc: "<p>This enchantment affects as many creatures as the caster
has CA levels, and each may be selected by the caster, so
long as they are within range. Targets must make a <i>sorcery</i>
saving throw, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if
applicable, or be compelled to carry out a <i>suggestion</i> (q.v.)
spoken by the sorcerer. Should the caster wish to target
but one creature, its <i>sorcery</i> saving throw will be at a âˆ’4
penalty. <i>Suggestions</i> should be neither overly complex
nor longer than one or two sentences, though each victim
may attempt to act upon such urgings for the duration of
the spell, if physically possible. <i>Suggesting</i> an obviously
self-destructive action breaks the spell on a 5-in-6 chance.
Of course, this spell is useless if sorcerer and ensorcelled
do not speak the same language.</p>"
