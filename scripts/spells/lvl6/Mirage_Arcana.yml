Desc: "<p>The sorcerer creates a phantasm that duplicates a familiar
area; this familiarity allows the caster to conjure
the details with great precision. The area of effect is a
10-foot radius per CA level; e.g., a CA 12 sorcerer effects
an illusion of no more than 120-foot radius. A vacant chamber
might be made to appear as elaborately furnished,
a muddy pond might appear as a swath of grass, a desert
might appear to have a small oasis, and so forth. The
actual contents within the illusion are masked. The illusion
has all the properties of quasi-reality: It has sight,
sound, smell, and touchâ€”even taste, should one pick
an apple from an illusory tree. However, the caster and
any allies cannot make use of <i>mirage arcana</i> to have a
comfortable place to sleep, for instance, because they do
not truly believe in it.</p>
<p>If the real contents of the illusion are forcibly shaken
or handled roughly, the creature doing so may make
a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>,
if applicable. If successful, the illusion begins
to shimmer, and the invisible object is revealed. If the
saving throw fails, the subject merely believes that
contact was made with an invisible object. Note that
casual and careful touching of masked objects is not
cause for a saving throw, because the illusion cannot be
disrupted unless handled with force. <i>Dispel phantasm</i>
can break this spell, revealing that which is concealed
by the illusion, but <i>dispel magic</i> and <i>detect invisibility</i>
are ineffective.</p>"
