Desc: "<p>This spell is cast whilst moving. An illusory duplicate
of the sorcerer is created at the same instant that the
caster becomes invisible (see <i>invisibility</i> spell, albeit
for only as long as the <i>mislead</i> spell lasts). The caster
is then at liberty to move elsewhere as the illusory double
continues forth.</p>
<p>Through a continuous mental connexion, the sorcerer
can command the image to speak; likewise, it will
mimic the casterâ€™s manner of walking, body language,
facial expressions, and so forth. The phantasm will
leave footprints and other physical signs of passage.
If attacked it will appear to dodge, block, or shimmer
as though some protective sorcery were in effect. It
can be disrupted by <i>dispel phantasm</i>; otherwise, it will
persist until the duration expires. No saving throw is
permitted to disbelieve this illusion.</p>"
