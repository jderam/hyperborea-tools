Desc: "<p>Requires 1 turn to cast. The sorcerer causes dirt (but
never solid rock) to move. A hill can be formed or a
trench excavated. The dirt is moved at 60 feet per turn.
The sorcerer is able to manipulate a volume of earth
equal to a cube with sides 10 feet long per CA level;
e.g., a CA 12 sorcerer can affect a 120 × 120 × 120-foot
area. Once the spell ends, the effect is permanent.</p>"
