Desc: "<p>A visual illusion is created, a projected image of
nearly anything the caster can imagine, as large as
60 × 60 × 60 feet in area. Victims must be living creatures
of animal intelligence or greater; undead, constructs,
oozes, and the like are unaffected. <i>Permanent
phantasm</i> can be used to create an attacking monster or
another damaging hazard. The illusion can be of sight,
sound, smell, and/or temperature. The auditory component
might include a shout, a roar, or a sentence of no
more than nine words in length (not including articles
<i>a</i>, <i>an</i>, and <i>the</i>).</p>
<p>Once cast, this spell persists infinitely, with no need of
concentration unless the caster wishes to manipulate
the movements of the illusion; such manoeuvres require
full attention, though the sorcerer can walk at half speed
and maintain control. The illusion is broken if struck
for 1 hp of damage or greater, or it can be terminated
via a <i>dispel phantasm</i> spell. A <i>permanent phantasmal</i>
monster is AC 3 and disappears if hit; otherwise, it can
continue to attack without caster direction.</p>
<p><i>Permanent phantasm</i> targets are not allowed saving
throws unless the referee feels the illusion is unbelievable,
in which case <i>sorcery</i> saving throws may be rolled,
modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable. With
sight, sound, smell, and/or temperature, credibility is
rarely an issue with this spell; if such a case arises, and
the save is made, the disbeliever will see the <i>permanent
phantasm</i> as a flawed and flickering transparent
image. An intelligent disbeliever may then alert allies,
whose saves are made at a bonus of +4. Otherwise,
this illusion can inflict real physical damage: 1d8 hp per
CA level per round to each victim. Such damage will
remain even if the spell is subsequently broken.</p>"
