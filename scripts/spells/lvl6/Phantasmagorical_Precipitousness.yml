Desc: "<p>This potent phantasm relates to the effects of falling,
sliding, or rushing water. <i>Phantasmagorical precipitousness</i>
is a programmed illusion triggered by some
predetermined event such as opening a door, falling in
a pit, descending stairs, and so forth. The sorcerer can
effect an illusion that is as large as 90 × 90 feet in area.</p>
<p>Those exposed to the spell are allowed <i>sorcery</i> saving
throws, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if applicable.
If they fail, they believe what they see; hence, the
spell’s effects are real for its victims. For example, if
an <b>orc</b> that falls down a 10-foot pit believes it is falling
70 feet, then it will indeed sustain damage as though
it had fallen 70 feet; if another orc believes the stairs
it was descending have turned into a slide, then it will
indeed slide to some unknown fate; and if an orc opening
a heavy iron door believes it is being swept away
by water, then it will indeed be swept away. This spell
is open to the caster’s imagination, but must always be
associated with falling, sliding, or rushing water.</p>"
