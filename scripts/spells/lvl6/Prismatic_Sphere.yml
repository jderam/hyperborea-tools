Desc: "<p>The illusionist creates a semi-opaque globe through
which all seven colours of the visible spectrum shimmer
rapidly. The caster stands at the center of the sphere,
which is 20 feet in diameter; the lower half of the sphere
will be obscured by the floor or ground the caster stands
upon (unless flying or levitating). Movement of 10 feet
per round is possible, the sphere staying centered
around the caster, but if the caster moves too quickly
the spell is terminated. An ally may leave the sphere
without affecting the spell but cannot reenter as per the
violet colour of the sphere (see below). <i>Prismatic sphere</i>
provides several protective effects. They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Red stops all non-magical missiles</li>
<li>Orange stops all magical missiles; e.g., <i>flaming
missile</i>, <i>magic ice dart</i>, <i>magic missile</i>, <i>acid arrow</i></li>
<li>Yellow stops all poisons and gases from entering
the sphere</li>
<li>Green repels all breath weapons and petrifaction
effects</li>
<li>Blue prevents all detection or location magic
from penetrating the sphere</li>
<li>Indigo negates the effects of all rods, staves, and
wands</li>
<li>Violet repels any creature from entering the
sphere from outside, friend or foe alike; targets
hurled backward 2d6 feet and <i>stunned</i> for 3d4
rounds; <i>sorcery</i> saving throw negates</ul>
<p>A <i>prismatic sphere</i> may be destroyed by a <i>dispel
phantasm</i> spell or by use of <i>dispel magic</i>; for the latter,
however, one such spell is required for each colour
in succession: red, orange, etc.</p>"
