Desc: "<p>Creates a <i>spectral phantasm</i> spell (q.v.) that activates
when a precondition is met, or by a command word
from the caster. The trigger might be when a particular
door is opened, when a passage is entered, when
a gate is approached, or the like. Once activated, its
duration and other effects are exactly as the <i>spectral
phantasm</i> spell. Until it is activated, the caster can
cast one fewer level six spell unless <i>programmed
phantasm</i> is cancelled.</p>"
