Desc: "<p>Causes dismembered limbs (arms, legs, tails), or parts
of limbs (fingers, toes, hands, feet), to grow back. The
<i>regeneration</i> spell can also apply to shattered bones or
subtracted organs. Casting this spell takes 6 rounds
(1 minute) if the severed parts are present and touching
the subject at the site of dismemberment; otherwise,
it takes 6 turns for this process to complete. Note
that in cases of decapitation, the original head must
be present; otherwise, it is not enough to save the
hopelessly beheaded, for it but causes the creation of a
mindless, drooling imbecile. <i>Regeneration</i> also repairs
up to 1d10+10 hp of damage. The material component
of this spell is the tail of a lizard or the arm of a starfish.</p>"
