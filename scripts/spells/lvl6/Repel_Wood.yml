Desc: "<p>Causes successive waves of force to roll forth in the
direction the sorcerer faces. Any wooden objects of no
more than six-inch thickness in this path (e.g., tables,
chairs, spear shafts, weapon hafts, arrows, wooden
shields) are forced away from the caster; if something
holds onto such an object, it either will be dragged back
with the object, or the object bursts into splinters and
will move as this sorcery dictates (i.e., a person might
be pulled by their axe, whereas a door might burst
from its hinges). The wave of force is 60 feet wide and
travels at 40 MV to a distance of 20 feet per CA level.</p>"
