Desc: "<p>The sorcerer creates a path that is 10 feet wide and
extends 30 feet. All creatures in this path suffer <i>repulsion</i>
and are compelled to flee from the sorcerer at
30 MV until they are beyond the 120-foot spell range.
Victims gain no saving throws if they are of 6 HD or
fewer; creatures of 7 HD or more are allowed <i>sorcery</i>
saving throws, modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>, if
applicable, to resist <i>repulsion</i>. The caster can walk at
half speed, concentrating to maintain this dweomer
until the duration is met. Those affected can do nothing
but flee for the duration of the spell. If a <i>repulsed</i>
creature is attacked whilst fleeing, the effect is broken
for that creature.</p>"
