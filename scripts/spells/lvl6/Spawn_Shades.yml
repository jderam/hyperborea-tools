Desc: "<p>From the impossible depths of the Black Gulf, the sorcerer
extracts negative energy to generate quasi-real
<i>shades</i>. The sorcerer can create a single
monster or multiple monsters, so long as their HD
total does not exceed the sorcererâ€™s CA level. If multiple
monsters are created, they must all be of the same
creature type.</p>
<p>The shades all are AC 5 and use d8 for hit
dice, regardless of their type. <i>Shades</i> cannot
use special abilities; they strictly make physical attacks.
A <i>shade</i> <b>cave bear</b>, for example, can make its normal
claw/claw/bite attack, but a <i>shadow</i> <b>giant scorpion</b> has
no venom in its sting. A <i>shade</i> can be struck
only by silver or magical weapons, the former of which
inflict double damage; too, any creature of 6 HD or
greater can strike a <i>shade</i>. Spells that deliver
physical damage also can affect them. A <i>shade</i>
can be dispersed by <i>dispel phantasm</i>.</p>"
