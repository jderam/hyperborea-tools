Desc: "<p>Imbues a rock or rocky surface with the ability to
communicate the name and/or type of any creature
that has touched it. The stone can also divulge what is
behind it or what it conceals, and provide a full visual
description as required by the sorcerer. However, the
entire effect is empathic; no words are spoken.</p>"
