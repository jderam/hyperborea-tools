Desc: "<p>Transmutes rock to soft tissue. If cast on a person who
was petrified by a monster, they will be restored, along
with all carried possessions; however, the recipient
first must make a <i>trauma survival</i> check to determine
whether the transformation is survived (see <b>Chapter 3:
Statistics</b>, <i>constitution</i>). If cast on raw stone, such as
the wall of a dungeon, this spell transforms as much as
a 10 × 10 × 10-foot cube of rock into flesh. The reverse
of this spell, <i>flesh to stone</i>, causes a single creature to
petrify if a <i>transformation</i> saving throw fails.</p>"
