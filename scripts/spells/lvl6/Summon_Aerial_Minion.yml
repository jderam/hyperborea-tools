Desc: "<p>The sorcerer calls an extra-dimensional <b>aerial minion</b>
to serve him. The creature is naturally invisible and arrives
1 round after being <i>summoned</i>. Before casting,
the sorcerer must etch with chalk a magic circle and
then sit cross-legged within its candlelit confines; otherwise,
the creature will attack. An aerial minion is not
<i>summoned</i> to fight; rather, its function is to find and
retrieve an object or creature as described and located
by the caster. If the aerial minion cannot complete its
task by the time the spellâ€™s duration expires, it will return
to slay the sorcerer.</p>"
