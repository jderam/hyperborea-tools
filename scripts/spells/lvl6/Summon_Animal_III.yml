Desc: "<p>Allows the sorcerer to call upon the aid of one or more
powerful beasts. The <i>summoned</i> animal type must be
specified. In Hyperborea, these animals may include
<b>1 cave bear</b>, <b>1 sabre-tooth</b>, or <b>2 winter wolves</b>.
Rudely the animals are conjured to a location within
the spellâ€™s range. At once the caster must charge the
animals with a simple, one-sentence task. The animals
will hear, understand, and be compelled to obey. The
task might be to fight, guard, work, or the like. Once
the task is complete the spell is ended, and the animals
will disappear whence they came.</p>"
