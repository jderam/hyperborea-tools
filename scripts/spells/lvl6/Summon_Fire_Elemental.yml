Desc: "<p>This conjuration requires 1 turn to cast and may be
performed but once per day. The sorcerer <i>summons</i>
a <b>class II fire elemental</b> to serve. On a 1-in-6 chance,
this spell instead conjures <b>2 fire salamanders</b>.</p>
<p>A conjured creature will obey the bidding of the caster,
performing all actions, including labour or combat, to
the best of its ability,. The sorcerer need not maintain
concentration on the creature’s activity; other
tasks (e.g., fighting or casting other spells) may be
performed whilst the creature continues to heed the
caster’s will. The sorcerer requires not the protection
of a magic circle, for the <i>summoned</i> creature will not
turn against him or her. The caster may not be aware
of this fact, however.</p>"
