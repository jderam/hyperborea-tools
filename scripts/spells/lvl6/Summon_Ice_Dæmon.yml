Desc: "<p>This conjuration requires 1 turn to cast and may be
performed but once per day. The sorcerer <i>summons</i> a
<b>gnoph-yikk</b>, a dæmon of the ice. The conjured dæmon
will obey the bidding of the caster, performing all
actions, including labour or combat, to the best of its
ability. Concentration on the dæmon’s activity need
not be maintained; the sorcerer can go about performing
other tasks (e.g., fighting or casting other spells)
whilst the ice dæmon continues to heed the summoner’s
will. Nonetheless, on a 1-in-6 chance per turn, the
ice dæmon will attack its master and/or any comrades;
however, it cannot breach a candlelit magic circle.</p>"
