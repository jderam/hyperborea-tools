Desc: "<p>Conjures an indiscernible, eight-foot-tall, extra-dimensional
being to perform a task or service, which might be
guardianship, combat, or the like. The <b>invisible stalker</b>
is a flawless tracker, able to follow any trail not more
than two weeks old. It is intelligent and oft possessed
of hatred and loathing. It resents lengthy missions or
assignments (i.e., those that last a week or more), and it
will seek to follow the letter of the command whilst perverting
the spirit or intent. An invisible stalker serves
until its mission is completed, or until it is destroyed
physically or by a <i>dispel magic</i> spell.</p>"
