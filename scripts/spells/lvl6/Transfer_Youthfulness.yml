Desc: "<p>This Evil spell must be cast under a full moon (Phobos
or Selene), the victim lashed to a stone table and
bathed in moonlight. The victim must be of the same
gender as the sorcerer and aged 25 or younger. Upon
the culmination of a 6-turn (1-hour) ritual of nameless
rites and incantations, which also requires the sacrifice
of 1,000 gp worth of gems, the sorcerer lays hands on
the victim, draining him or her of youthfulness. The
sorcerer becomes young, whilst the victim must make
a <i>death</i> saving throw.</p>
<p>If the saving throw fails, the victim withers and dies; if
the save succeeds, the victim becomes elderly and senile.
Only a <i>restoration</i> spell can restore the victim to
their true age, pending a <i>trauma survival</i> check (see
<b>Chapter 3: Statistics</b>, <i>constitution</i>); otherwise, they
die. A sorcerer who has used this spell is sometimes
revealed by their shadow, which never reflects a young
person, but an elderly wizard or hag.</p>"
