Desc: "<p>A popular spell amongst the most accomplished Ixian
necromancers, this 1-turn ritual culminates in the
shedding of the sorcererâ€™s human skin (and any other
effects) to assume the form of a <b>giant asp</b>, a dark,
narrow-hooded cobra of about 12-foot length. This
transmogrification includes all physical and special
abilities, and it heals all damage previously suffered.
<i>True seeing</i> reveals the asp for its actual shape.</p>
<p><i>Transform to asp</i> persists for as long as the caster
wishes, unless the transformed individual is reduced to
0 hp or fewer, in which case the true form is revealed,
naked and unconscious. Those who remain in asp form
for more than one week risk losing their humanity.
This spell can be broken by <i>dispel magic</i>.</p>"
