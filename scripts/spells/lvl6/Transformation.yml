Desc: "<p>The sorcerer must quaff a <b>potion of heroic action</b> or
<b>potion of super-heroic action</b> to cast this spell. After
imbibing and speaking the incantation, the sorcerer increases
in size and strength to herculean proportions.
Indeed, the sorcerer takes the aspect of a berserk killing
machine! Note the following changes:</p>
<ul><li>Hit points doubled; subsequent damage is
subtracted from the “false total” first</li>
<li>+4 AC</li>
<li>Fighting ability of a fighter of equal level
(i.e., FA equal to CA)</li>
<li>3/2 melee attack rate</li>
<li>Attacks at 18 strength; i.e., +2 “to hit” and
+3 damage</li>
<li>Intense battle lust; will not stop attacking
enemies until they are dead, the sorcerer is
dead, or the spell ends</li></ul>
<p><i>N.B.:</i> Other spells cannot be cast whilst the <i>transformation</i>
spell is in effect.</p>"
