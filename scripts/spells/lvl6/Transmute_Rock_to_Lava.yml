Desc: "<p>Changes earth, gravel, rock, or sand into hot lava. The
sorcerer affects an area as large as 40 × 40 feet and
1 foot deep. If this spell takes effect under the feet of
an enemy, this foe will die a horrible, liquifying death
unless an <i>avoidance</i> save is made, in which case 5d6 hp
damage is suffered. Movement through the lava is at 10
MV, with a save required for each round of exposure.
When the spell’s duration elapses, the lava dries to light,
porous rock, potentially trapping victims (<i>avoidance</i>
save to escape); those so trapped require <i>extraordinary
feats of strength</i> to break free. The reverse of this spell,
<i>transmute lava to rock</i>, hardens lava into solid stone,
affecting a 10 × 10 × 10-foot area per CA level.</p>"
