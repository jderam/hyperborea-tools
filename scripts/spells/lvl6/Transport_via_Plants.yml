Desc: "<p>The sorcerer or other recipient can step within any
large plant and pass almost any distance to another
plant of like size and species. This transference is effected
in but 1 round, regardless of distance. The traveler
need not be familiar with the precise destination
plant; indeed, only direction and distance are required.
The dweomer will then transport the spellâ€™s subject
to the closest available specimen. (Of course, it can be
many miles away from the desired location, depending
on circumstances.) Upon arrival, the subject need not
step out from the destination plant immediately; one
may remain within, observing with all normal senses
and those of the plant itself. Egress can be delayed for
up to 24 hours, but if the plant is not stepped out from
within that time, the subject will be ejected violently
for 6d6 hp damage.</p>"
