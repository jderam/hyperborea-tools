Desc: "<p>Makes the caster and allies appear as something they
are not. The sorcerer can affect allies in a 40-foot radius,
but they must be willing participants. <i>Veil</i> can make
them look as though they were inanimate objects such
as boxes or kegs, small trees or shrubs; or perhaps dogs,
<b>orcs</b>, or anything else imagined by the caster, so long as
it is something with which the caster is familiar. Exact
features cannot be duplicated. For example, whilst a
band of guards who wear black chain mail and red capes
may be imitated, the face of their captain cannot.</p>"
