Desc: "<p>By the sorcerer’s touch, a death spell is delivered. The
target must make a <i>death</i> saving throw or receive the
spell’s mark and die. The victim of this spell is left with
a pale handprint on their chest (the mark concealed
unless the chest is bare). The <i>white hand of death</i>
imprint remains burnt on the victim’s chest for nine
days. Unless the body is incinerated, any creature who
touches the body must also make a <i>death</i> save or die,
branded with their own pale white handprint—and so
spreads the contagion known as the <i>white death</i>.</p>"
