    <p>Enchants a stone that functions at +1 “to hit” and
        damage (i.e., 2 hp if thrown, or 1d4+1 hp if fired from
        a sling). Each stone issues a sharp report upon impact.
        For every 3 CA levels one stone is enchanted:</p>

        <p><i>Magic stones</i> can be launched with a sling or hurled as
        normal stones by the caster or an ally. Only one stone
        can be hurled at a time unless the target is no more
        than 10 feet away, in which case multiple stones may be
        hurled. Once a <i>magic stone</i> is tossed, its enchantment
        is lost, whether it strikes its intended target or not. If
        a sorcerer is struck by a <i>magic stone</i> whilst casting a
        spell, the spell is disrupted, even if the optional <i>concentration
        check</i> is in play, and spell loss is automatic.</p>

    <p>The illusionist creates a glowing, palm-sized sphere
        of energy based on one of the seven colours of the
        visible spectrum. The <i>prismatic orb</i> may be hurled
        up to 30 feet at a single foe. This functions as a missile
        attack roll with a bonus +2 “to hit” against the
        target’s armour class. The colour of orb conjured is
        determined randomly by a d8; a result of <i>8</i> indicates
        a special orb that cycles rapidly between two colours,
        delivering the effects of both colours.</p>

        and is penalized –1 “to hit” and damage rolls
        for 1d2 + CA level in rounds.</td></tr>

        throw modified by <i>willpower adjustment</i>

        <p>A <i>prismatic orb</i> may not be hurled through barriers
        and will return to the caster’s palm up to three times
        if it misses its intended target; however, each time it
        returns to the caster’s palm, a (possibly) new colour(s)
        takes form; i.e., a d8 must be rolled again. A returned
        orb must be hurled on the next round or it disappears.</p>
