    <p>Enchants a stone that functions at +1 “to hit” and
        damage (i.e., 2 hp if thrown, or 1d4+1 hp if fired from
        a sling). Each stone issues a sharp report upon impact.
        For every 3 CA levels one stone is enchanted:</p>

        <p><i>Magic stones</i> can be launched with a sling or hurled as
        normal stones by the caster or an ally. Only one stone
        can be hurled at a time unless the target is no more
        than 10 feet away, in which case multiple stones may be
        hurled. Once a <i>magic stone</i> is tossed, its enchantment
        is lost, whether it strikes its intended target or not. If
        a sorcerer is struck by a <i>magic stone</i> whilst casting a
        spell, the spell is disrupted, even if the optional <i>concentration
        check</i> is in play, and spell loss is automatic.</p>

    <p>The illusionist creates a glowing, palm-sized sphere
        of energy based on one of the seven colours of the
        visible spectrum. The <i>prismatic orb</i> may be hurled
        up to 30 feet at a single foe. This functions as a missile
        attack roll with a bonus +2 “to hit” against the
        target’s armour class. The colour of orb conjured is
        determined randomly by a d8; a result of <i>8</i> indicates
        a special orb that cycles rapidly between two colours,
        delivering the effects of both colours.</p>

        <p>A <i>prismatic orb</i> may not be hurled through barriers
        and will return to the caster’s palm up to three times
        if it misses its intended target; however, each time it
        returns to the caster’s palm, a (possibly) new colour(s)
        takes form; i.e., a d8 must be rolled again. A returned
        orb must be hurled on the next round or it disappears.</p>

    <p>The target of this spell (human, humanoid, or giant)
        must make a <i>sorcery</i> saving throw, modified by <i>willpower
        adjustment</i>, if applicable. If the save fails, the
        victim views the caster as a close and trusted comrade
        to be protected and defended for the duration of the
        spell. If the ensorcelled victim understands the caster’s
        language, the caster can “suggest” the victim perform
        various tasks, so long as they are not diametrically opposite
        to the victim’s nature.</p>
        <p>The spell <i>dispel magic</i> can cancel this spell. Otherwise,
        additional <i>sorcery</i> saving throws (<i>willpower adjustment</i>
        applies) are allowed to break the spell at a time
        predicated on the targets intelligence (IN) score.:</p>
        <ul><li>13–18 IN = new save every 6 turns</li>
        <li>9–12 IN = new save every 24 hours</li>
        <li>3–8 IN = new save once per week</li></ul>

    <p>Sorcery transports one or more <b>lesser dæmons</b> from
        Underborea as selected by the sorcerer, depending on
        need. The dæmons will arrive 1 round after the spell is
        cast and will perform their designated task, after which,
        dead or alive, they will either disappear or turn on the
        caster and/or any allies (see below). When casting this
        spell, the sorcerer must explicitly state the <i>summoned</i>
        type: “defender,” “illuminator,” or “seeker.”</p>
        <ul><li><b>Defender</b>: <i>Summons</i> a random dæmon or
        dæmons to assault the sorcerer’s enemies as directed
        for no longer than 6 rounds. The target(s)
        must be pointed out straight away, or else the
        dæmon will attack the sorcerer and/or any allies.
        If the stated target(s) is defeated, the standard
        chance of betrayal applies.
        <table><caption><b>Table 113: Summon Dæmon I Spell</b></caption>
        <tr><th>d6 Result</th> <th>Defender(s) Summoned</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1–3</td> <td>Dæmon, Lesser, Class i (1d2)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4–5</td> <td>Dæmon, Lesser, Class ii (1d2)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6</td> <td>Dæmon, Lesser, Class iii (1)</td></tr></table></li>
        <li><b>Illuminator</b>: <i>Summons</i> a single <b>class iv lesser
        dæmon</b>. When the <i>illuminator</i> type is designated,
        the corpse or bones of a dead human or
        humanoid must be present and obvious, or else
        the dæmon will attack the sorcerer and/or any
        allies. The questioning of the dead will then commence,
        with as many as three questions asked,
        as explained by the sorcerer to the dæmon. Once
        this process is complete, the standard chance of
        betrayal applies.</li>
        <li><b>Seeker</b>: <i>Summons</i> a single <b>class v lesser dæmon</b>
        to search and destroy. When the <i>seeker</i> type is
        designated, the sorcerer also must describe the
        prey (name, species, and so forth). The dæmon
        then will track its quarry until it is found and
        killed, after which the standard chance of betrayal
        applies. If no trail is found within 6 rounds, the
        dæmon will attack the sorcerer and/or any allies.
        If called upon to face an enemy that it cannot
        hunt, it will turn on the sorcerer.</li></ul>
        <p><i>Betrayal:</i> Dæmons are infamous for betrayal. Upon
        completing their prescribed task, they may turn on the
        sorcerer and/or any allies on a 1-in-6 chance. Dæmons
        are, however, subject to morale checks during the
        entire <i>summon dæmon</i> process. Those that fail will
        attempt to flee (if possible), now permanent inhabitants
        of Hyperborea that may one day seek revenge.
        Wise sorcerers are known to take sanctuary within the
        confines of a candlelit magic circle whilst casting and
        maintaining this spell; of course, the magic circle will
        only protect the sorcerer, not allies.</p>
